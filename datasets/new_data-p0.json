In many application areas, decisions can only be made by exploring alternative scenarios. The goal of the suggested approach is to support users in this decision making process. In this setting, the data domain is extended to a set of alternative worlds where only one outcome will actually happen. World Lines integrate simulation, visualization and computational steering into a single unified system that is capable of dealing with the extended solution space. World Lines represent simulation runs as causally connected tracks that share a common time axis. This setup enables users to interfere and add new information quickly. A World Line is introduced as a visual combination of user events and their effects in order to present a possible future. To quickly find the most attractive outcome, we suggest World Lines as the governing component in a system of multiple linked views and a simulation component. World Lines employ linking and brushing to enable comparative visual analysis of multiple simulations in linked views. Analysis results can be mapped to various visual variables that World Lines provide in order to highlight the most compelling solutions. To demonstrate this technique we present a flooding scenario and show the usefulness of the integrated approach to support informed decision making.","Authors":"Waser, J.;Fuchs, R.;Ribicic, H.;Schindler, B.;Bloschl, G.;Groller, E.","Clusters":"ApplicationsGeneralAndOther;FlowVisualizationDataAndTechniques;ParticleVisualizationAndTechniques;ReasoningProblemSolvingAndDecisionMaking;Simulation","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2010.223","Keywords":"decision making;simulation steering;computational fluid dynamics;smoothed particle hydrodynamics;parallel worlds;problem solving environments","Keywords_Processed":"simulation steering;decision make;smoothed particle hydrodynamic;problem solve environment;computational fluid dynamic;parallel world","Title":"World Lines"},"201":{"Abstract":"The relationship between candidates' position on a ballot paper and vote rank is explored in the case of 5000 candidates for the UK 2010 local government elections in the Greater London area. This design study uses hierarchical spatially arranged graphics to represent two locations that affect candidates at very different scales: the geographical areas for which they seek election and the spatial location of their names on the ballot paper. This approach allows the effect of position bias to be assessed; that is, the degree to which the position of a candidate's name on the ballot paper influences the number of votes received by the candidate, and whether this varies geographically. Results show that position bias was significant enough to influence rank order of candidates, and in the case of many marginal electoral wards, to influence who was elected to government. Position bias was observed most strongly for Liberal Democrat candidates but present for all major political parties. Visual analysis of classification of candidate names by ethnicity suggests that this too had an effect on votes received by candidates, in some cases overcoming alphabetic name bias. The results found contradict some earlier research suggesting that alphabetic name bias was not sufficiently significant to affect electoral outcome and add new evidence for the geographic and ethnicity influences on voting behaviour. The visual approach proposed here can be applied to a wider range of electoral data and the patterns identified and hypotheses derived from them could have significant implications for the design of ballot papers and the conduct of fair elections.","Authors":"Wood, J.;Badawood, D.;Dykes, J.;Slingsby, A.","Clusters":"ApplicationsGeneralAndOther;Cognition;GeographyGeospatialVisCartographyTerrainVis;HierarchicalTreeDataAndTechniques;SocialScienceAndHumanities","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2011.174","Keywords":"democracy;hierarchy;election;bias;treemap;governance;voting;geovisualization","Keywords_Processed":"hierarchy;treemap;governance;election;democracy;geovisualization;bias;voting","Title":"BallotMaps: Detecting Name Bias in Alphabetically Ordered Ballot Papers"},"169":{"Abstract":"Lighting design is a complex, but fundamental, problem in many fields. In volume visualization, direct volume rendering generates an informative image without external lighting, as each voxel itself emits radiance. However, external lighting further improves the shape and detail perception of features, and it also determines the effectiveness of the communication of feature information. The human visual system is highly effective in extracting structural information from images, and to assist it further, this paper presents an approach to structure-aware automatic lighting design by measuring the structural changes between the images with and without external lighting. Given a transfer function and a viewpoint, the optimal lighting parameters are those that provide the greatest enhancement to structural information - the shape and detail information of features are conveyed most clearly by the optimal lighting parameters. Besides lighting goodness, the proposed metric can also be used to evaluate lighting similarity and stability between two sets of lighting parameters. Lighting similarity can be used to optimize the selection of multiple light sources so that different light sources can reveal distinct structural information. Our experiments with several volume data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the structure-aware lighting design approach. It is well suited to use by novices as it requires little technical understanding of the rendering parameters associated with direct volume rendering.","Authors":"Yubo Tao;Hai Lin;Feng Dong;Chao Wang;Clapworthy, G.;Hujun Bao","Clusters":"ComparisonComparativeVisualizationAndSimilarity;Illumination;VolumeRenderingModelingAndVisualization","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2012.267","Keywords":"structural dissimilarity;lighting similarity;volume rendering;lighting stability;automatic lighting design","Keywords_Processed":"volume render;structural dissimilarity;light stability;lighting similarity;automatic lighting design","Title":"Structure-Aware Lighting Design for Volume Visualization"},"45":{"Abstract":"Rankings are a popular and universal approach to structuring otherwise unorganized collections of items by computing a rank for each item based on the value of one or more of its attributes. This allows us, for example, to prioritize tasks or to evaluate the performance of products relative to each other. While the visualization of a ranking itself is straightforward, its interpretation is not, because the rank of an item represents only a summary of a potentially complicated relationship between its attributes and those of the other items. It is also common that alternative rankings exist which need to be compared and analyzed to gain insight into how multiple heterogeneous attributes affect the rankings. Advanced visual exploration tools are needed to make this process efficient. In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of requirements for the visualization of multi-attribute rankings. Based on these considerations, we propose LineUp - a novel and scalable visualization technique that uses bar charts. This interactive technique supports the ranking of items based on multiple heterogeneous attributes with different scales and semantics. It enables users to interactively combine attributes and flexibly refine parameters to explore the effect of changes in the attribute combination. This process can be employed to derive actionable insights as to which attributes of an item need to be modified in order for its rank to change. Additionally, through integration of slope graphs, LineUp can also be used to compare multiple alternative rankings on the same set of items, for example, over time or across different attribute combinations. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-attribute visualization technique in a qualitative study. The study shows that users are able to successfully solve complex ranking tasks in a short period of time.","Authors":"Gratzl, S.;Lex, A.;Gehlenborg, N.;Pfister, H.;Streit, M.","Clusters":"ChartsDiagramsPlots;DataFacetsAndTechniques;EvaluationGeneral;InteractionTechniquesGeneral;MultidimensionalMultivariateMultifieldDataAndTechniques;Ranking","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2013.173","Keywords":"ranking;stacked bar charts;scoring;multi-factorial;multi-attribute;multi-faceted;ranking visualization","Keywords_Processed":"multi factorial;multi attribute;score;rank;stack bar chart;multi faceted;rank visualization","Title":"LineUp: Visual Analysis of Multi-Attribute Rankings"},"284":{"Abstract":"Visual analysis is widely used to study the behavior of molecules.

For the interactive visualization of molecules and their paths, we present several methods using deferred shading and other state-of-theart techniques. To allow for a fast overview of reachable regions of the molecule, we illuminate the molecular surface using a large number of light sources placed on the extracted paths.

To save time and reduce memory load, users are only involved in the first step - initialization of sampling - and the last step - visual analysis of output. This helps users to more thoroughly explore the parameter space and produce higher quality results. We describe a custom sampling plug-in we developed for CellProfiler - a popular biomedical image analysis framework. Our main focus is the development of an interactive visualization technique that enables users to analyze the relationships between sampled input parameters and corresponding output. We implemented this in a prototype called Paramorama. It provides users with a visual overview of parameters and their sampled values.

The utility of displaying tensor field samples has driven the development of visualization techniques that encode the tensor shape and orientation into the geometry of a tensor glyph. With some exceptions, these methods work only for positive-definite tensors (i.e. having positive eigenvalues, such as diffusion tensors). We expand the scope of tensor glyphs to all symmetric second-order tensors in two and three dimensions, gracefully and unambiguously depicting any combination of positive and negative eigenvalues. We generalize a previous method of superquadric glyphs for positive-definite tensors by drawing upon a larger portion of the superquadric shape space, supplemented with a coloring that indicates the tensor's quadratic form. We show that encoding arbitrary eigenvalue sign combinations requires design choices that differ fundamentally from those in previous work on traceless tensors (arising in the study of liquid crystals). Our method starts with a design of 2-D tensor glyphs guided by principles of symmetry and continuity, and creates 3-D glyphs that include the 2-D glyphs in their axis-aligned cross-sections. A key ingredient of our method is a novel way of mapping from the shape space of three-dimensional symmetric second-order tensors to the unit square. We apply our new glyphs to stress tensors from mechanics, geometry tensors and Hessians from image analysis, and rate-of-deformation tensors in computational fluid dynamics.","Authors":"Schultz, T.;Kindlmann, G.","Clusters":"GlyphsGlyphBasedTechniques;TensorDataAndTechniques","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2010.199","Keywords":"stress tensor;glyph design;geometry tensors;rate-of-deformation tensors;tensor glyphs","Keywords_Processed":"stress tensor;geometry tensor;tensor glyph;glyph design;rate of deformation tensor","Title":"Superquadric Glyphs for Symmetric Second-Order Tensors"},"58":{"Abstract":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide.

In this paper, we propose a fast high-quality volume ray-casting algorithm which effectively increases the sampling rate. While a ray traverses the volume, intensity values are uniformly reconstructed using a high-order convolution filter. Additional samplings, referred to as virtual samplings, are carried out within a ray segment from a cubic spline curve interpolating those uniformly reconstructed intensities. These virtual samplings are performed by evaluating the polynomial function of the cubic spline curve via simple arithmetic operations. The min max blocks are refined accordingly for accurate empty space skipping in the proposed method.

Visual exploration of these fields provides comprehensive insight into the unsteady blood-flow behavior, and precedes a quantitative analysis of additional blood-flow parameters. The complete inspection requires accurate segmentation of anatomical structures, encompassing a time-consuming and hard-to-automate process, especially for malformed morphologies. We present a way to avoid the laborious segmentation process in case of qualitative inspection, by introducing an interactive virtual probe. This probe is positioned semi-automatically within the blood-flow field, and serves as a navigational object for visual exploration. The difficult task of determining position and orientation along the view-direction is automated by a fitting approach, aligning the probe with the orientations of the velocity field. The aligned probe provides an interactive seeding basis for various flow visualization approaches.

Modern astronomical surveys provide not only image data but also catalogues of millions of objects (stars, galaxies), each object with hundreds of associated parameters. Exploration of this very high-dimensional data space poses a huge challenge. Subspace clustering is one among several approaches which have been proposed for this purpose in recent years. However, many clustering algorithms require the user to set a large number of parameters without any guidelines. Some methods also do not provide a concise summary of the datasets, or, if they do, they lack additional important information such as the number of clusters present or the significance of the clusters. In this paper, we propose a method for ranking subspaces for clustering which overcomes many of the above limitations. First we carry out a transformation from parametric space to discrete image space where the data are represented by a grid-based density field. Then we apply so-called connected morphological operators on this density field of astronomical objects that provides visual support for the analysis of the important subspaces. Clusters in subspaces correspond to high-intensity regions in the density image. The importance of a cluster is measured by a new quality criterion based on the dynamics of local maxima of the density. Connected operators are able to extract such regions with an indication of the number of clusters present. The subspaces are visualized during computation of the quality measure, so that the user can interact with the system to improve the results. In the result stage, we use three visualization toolkits linked within a graphical user interface so that the user can perform an in-depth exploration of the ranked subspaces. Evaluation based on synthetic as well as real astronomical datasets demonstrates the power of the new method.

Unlike previous work in this area, our technique segments the histogram into a reasonable set of intuitive components that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. We use information-theoretic measures of the volumetric data segments to guide the exploration.

The common process to create such synthetic datasets is to implement small scripts or programs, restricted to small problems or to a specific application. In this paper we propose a framework designed to generate high dimensional datasets. Users can interactively create and navigate through multi dimensional datasets using a suitable graphical user-interface. The data creation is driven by statistical distributions based on a few user-defined parameters. First, a grounding dataset is created according to given inputs, and then structures and trends are included in selected dimensions and orthogonal projection planes. Furthermore, our framework supports the creation of complex non-orthogonal trends and classified datasets.

We propose a computationally efficient algorithm for detecting symmetric patterns in a scalar field distribution by analysing the topology of level sets of the scalar field. Our algorithm computes the contour tree of a given scalar field and identifies subtrees that are similar. We define a robust similarity measure for comparing subtrees of the contour tree and use it to group similar subtrees together. Regions of the domain corresponding to subtrees that belong to a common group are extracted and reported to be symmetric.

This enables a more faithful representation of flow behaviors inside complex domains. In addition, we encode tensor magnitude, an important quantity in tensor field analysis, using the density of hyperstreamlines and sizes of glyphs. This allows colors to be used to encode other important tensor quantities. To facilitate quick visual exploration of the data from different viewpoints and at different resolutions, we employ an efficient image-space approach in which hyperstreamlines and glyphs are generated quickly in the image plane. The combination of these techniques leads to an efficient tensor field visualization system for domain scientists.

When seeing a volume visualization result, persons with CVD may be incapable of discriminating the classification information expressed in the image if the color transfer function or the color blending used in the direct volume rendering is not appropriate. Conventional methods used to address this problem adopt advanced image recoloring techniques to enhance the rendering results frame-by-frame; unfortunately, problematic perceptual results may still be generated. This paper proposes an alternative solution that complements the image recoloring scheme by reconfiguring the components of the direct volume rendering (DVR) pipeline. Our approach optimizes the mapped colors of a transfer function to simulate CVD-friendly effect that is generated by applying the image recoloring to the results with the initial transfer function. The optimization process has a low computational complexity, and only needs to be performed once for a given transfer function. To achieve detail-preserving and perceptually natural semi-transparent effects, we introduce a new color composition mode that works in the color space of dichromats. Experimental results and a pilot study demonstrates that our approach can yield dichromats-friendly and consistent volume visualization in real-time.","Authors":"Weifeng Chen;Wei Chen;Hujun Bao","Clusters":"ColorColorPerception;ImageBasedDataImageSignalProcessing;SegmentationAndClassification;VolumeRenderingModelingAndVisualization","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2011.164","Keywords":"direct volume rendering;image recoloring;dichromacy;volume classification","Keywords_Processed":"dichromacy;image recoloring;volume classification;direct volume render","Title":"An Efficient Direct Volume Rendering Approach for Dichromats"},"102":{"Abstract":"We characterize the design space of the algorithms that sequentially tile a rectangular area with smaller, fixed-surface, rectangles.

Creating perceptually effective treemaps requires carefully managing a number of design parameters including the aspect ratio and luminance of rectangles. Moreover, treemaps encode values using area, which has been found to be less accurate than judgments of other visual encodings, such as length. We conduct a series of controlled experiments aimed at producing a set of design guidelines for creating effective rectangular treemaps. We find no evidence that luminance affects area judgments, but observe that aspect ratio does have an effect. Specifically, we find that the accuracy of area comparisons suffers when the compared rectangles have extreme aspect ratios or when both are squares. Contrary to common assumptions, the optimal distribution of rectangle aspect ratios within a treemap should include non-squares, but should avoid extremes. We then compare treemaps with hierarchical bar chart displays to identify the data densities at which length-encoded bar charts become less effective than area-encoded treemaps. We report the transition points at which treemaps exhibit judgment accuracy on par with bar charts for both leaf and non-leaf tree nodes. We also find that even at relatively low data densities treemaps result in faster comparisons than bar charts. Based on these results, we present a set of guidelines for the effective use of treemaps and suggest alternate approaches for treemap layout.","Authors":"Kong, N.;Heer, J.;Agrawala, M.","Clusters":"EvaluationGeneral;HierarchicalTreeDataAndTechniques;Perception;VisualEncodingAndLayoutGeneral","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2010.186","Keywords":"mechanical turk;treemap;graphical perception;rectangular area;visualization;visual encoding;experiment","Keywords_Processed":"visualization;rectangular area;treemap;visual encoding;graphical perception;experiment;mechanical turk","Title":"Perceptual Guidelines for Creating Rectangular Treemaps"},"301":{"Abstract":"We introduce the concept of a Visual Backchannel as a novel way of following and exploring online conversations about large-scale events.

During analysis of data from previous perceptual studies, we observed that the slant of 3D surfaces visualized on 2D screens is systematically underestimated. The visible trends in the error allowed us to create a statistical model of the perceived surface slant. Based on this statistical model we obtained from user experiments, we derived a new shading model that uses adjusted surface normals and aims to reduce the error in slant perception. The result is a shape-enhancement of visualization which is driven by an experimentally-founded statistical model. To assess the efficiency of the statistical shading model, we repeated the evaluation experiment and confirmed that the error in perception was decreased.

While currently ignored by most visualization models, this translation entails a loss of information and the introduction of a number of artifacts that can be useful, (e.g., aggregation, structures) or distracting (e.g., over-plotting, clutter) for the analysis. This phenomenon is observed in parallel coordinates, where overlapping lines between adjacent axes form distinct patterns, representing the relation between variables they connect. However, even for a small number of dimensions, the challenge is to effectively convey the relationships for all combinations of dimensions. The size of the dataset and a large number of dimensions only add to the complexity of this problem. To address these issues, we propose Pargnostics, parallel coordinates diagnostics, a model based on screen-space metrics that quantify the different visual structures. Pargnostics metrics are calculated for pairs of axes and take into account the resolution of the display as well as potential axis inversions. Metrics include the number of line crossings, crossing angles, convergence, overplotting, etc. To construct a visualization view, the user can pick from a ranked display showing pairs of coordinate axes and the structures between them, or examine all possible combinations of axes at once in a matrix display.

The registration of these two scans is desirable so that the user can clarify situations or confirm polyp findings at a location in one scan with the same location in the other, thereby improving polyp detection rates and reducing false positives. However, this supine-prone registration is challenging because of the substantial distortions in the colon shape due to the patient's change in position. We present an efficient algorithm and framework for performing this registration through the use of conformal geometry to guarantee that the registration is a diffeomorphism (a one-to-one and onto mapping). The taeniae coli and colon flexures are automatically extracted for each supine and prone surface, employing the colon geometry. The two colon surfaces are then divided into several segments using the flexures, and each segment is cut along a taenia coli and conformally flattened to the rectangular domain using holomorphic differentials. The mean curvature is color encoded as texture images, from which feature points are automatically detected using graph cut segmentation, mathematic morphological operations, and principal component analysis. Corresponding feature points are found between supine and prone and are used to adjust the conformal flattening to be quasi-conformal, such that the features become aligned. We present multiple methods of visualizing our results, including 2D flattened rendering, corresponding 3D endoluminal views, and rendering of distortion measurements. We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our registration method by illustrating matched views on both the 2D flattened colon images and in the 3D volume rendered colon endoluminal view.

Here we propose a novel visualization design, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whisper\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, for tracing the process of information diffusion in social media in real time. Our design highlights three major characteristics of diffusion processes in social media: the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest. Such social, spatiotemporal processes are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersed far away. In Whisper, we summarize the collective responses of communities on a given topic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users, through representing the sentiments extracted from the tweets, and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial hierarchical layout. We use an efficient flux line-drawing algorithm to trace multiple pathways so the temporal and spatial patterns can be identified even for a bursty event. A focused diffusion series highlights key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process. We demonstrate how our design facilitates the understanding of when and where a piece of information is dispersed and what are the social responses of the crowd, for large-scale events including political campaigns and natural disasters. Initial feedback from domain experts suggests promising use for today's information consumption and dispersion in the wild.","Authors":"Nan Cao;Yu-Ru Lin;Xiaohua Sun;Lazer, D.;Shixia Liu;Huamin Qu","Clusters":"DiffusionRelatedTechniques;SocialNetworksAndSocialMedia;SpatiotemporalDataAndTechniques;","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2012.291","Keywords":"information visualization;contagion;social media;spatio-temporal patterns;microblogging;information diffusion","Keywords_Processed":"information diffusion;information visualization;contagion;spatio temporal pattern;microblogge;social medium","Title":"Whisper: Tracing the Spatiotemporal Process of Information Diffusion in Real Time"},"388":{"Abstract":"Insight Externalization (IE) refers to the process of capturing and recording the semantics of insights in decision making and problem solving. To reduce human effort, Automated Insight Externalization (AIE) is desired. Most existing IE approaches achieve automation by capturing events (e.g., clicks and key presses) or actions (e.g., panning and zooming). In this paper, we propose a novel AIE approach named Click2Annotate. It allows semi-automatic insight annotation that captures low-level analytics task results (e.g., clusters and outliers), which have higher semantic richness and abstraction levels than actions and events. Click2Annotate has two significant benefits. First, it reduces human effort required in IE and generates annotations easy to understand. Second, the rich semantic information encoded in the annotations enables various insight management activities, such as insight browsing and insight retrieval. We present a formal user study that proved this first benefit. We also illustrate the second benefit by presenting the novel insight management activities we developed based on Click2Annotate, namely scented insight browsing and faceted insight search.","Authors":"Yang Chen;Barlowe, S.;Jing Yang","Clusters":"AnalysisProcessGeneral;Labeling;MultidimensionalMultivariateMultifieldDataAndTechniques;ReasoningProblemSolvingAndDecisionMaking;","DOI":"10.1109\/VAST.2010.5652885","Keywords":"annotation;decision making;insight management;multi-dimensional visualization;visual analytics","Keywords_Processed":"multi dimensional visualization;decision make;visual analytic;insight management;annotation","Title":"Click2Annotate: Automated Insight Externalization with rich semantics"},"389":{"Abstract":"This paper highlights the important role that record-keeping (i.e. taking notes and saving charts) plays in collaborative data analysis within the business domain. The discussion of record-keeping is based on observations from a user study in which co-located teams worked on collaborative visual analytics tasks using large interactive wall and tabletop displays. Part of our findings is a collaborative data analysis framework that encompasses note taking as one of the main activities. We observed that record-keeping was a critical activity within the analysis process. Based on our observations, we characterize notes according to their content, scope, and usage, and describe how they fit into a process of collaborative data analysis. We then discuss suggestions for the design of collaborative visual analytics tools.","Authors":"Mahyar, N.;Sarvghad, A.;Tory, M.","Clusters":"CollaborativeVisualization;EvaluationGeneral;LargeAndHighResDisplays;ProvenanceAndHistory;","DOI":"10.1109\/VAST.2010.5652879","Keywords":"wall displays;collaboration;tabletop;note taking;provenance;recording;history","Keywords_Processed":"history;wall display;tabletop;collaboration;note take;recording;provenance","Title":"A closer look at note taking in the co-located collaborative visual analytics process"},"24":{"Abstract":"Visualizing symmetric patterns in the data often helps the domain scientists make important observations and gain insights about the underlying experiment. Detecting symmetry in scalar fields is a nascent area of research and existing methods that detect symmetry are either not robust in the presence of noise or computationally costly. We propose a data structure called the augmented extremum graph and use it to design a novel symmetry detection method based on robust estimation of distances. The augmented extremum graph captures both topological and geometric information of the scalar field and enables robust and computationally efficient detection of symmetry. We apply the proposed method to detect symmetries in cryo-electron microscopy datasets and the experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of detecting symmetry even in the presence of significant noise. We describe novel applications that use the detected symmetry to enhance visualization of scalar field data and facilitate their exploration.","Authors":"Thomas, D.M.;Natarajan, V.","Clusters":"AnalysisProcessGeneral;GraphNetworkDataAndTechniques;ScalarFieldDataTechniques;TopologyBasedTechniques;VisualPatternFeatureDetectionAndTracking","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2013.148","Keywords":"data exploration;scalar field visualization;extremum graph;morse decomposition;symmetry detection","Keywords_Processed":"symmetry detection;morse decomposition;extremum graph;scalar field visualization;datum exploration","Title":"Detecting Symmetry in Scalar fields Using Augmented Extremum Graphs"},"248":{"Abstract":"When visualizing tubular 3D structures, external representations are often used for guidance and display, and such views in 2D can often contain occlusions. Virtual dissection methods have been proposed where the entire 3D structure can be mapped to the 2D plane, though these will lose context by straightening curved sections. We present a new method of creating maps of 3D tubular structures that yield a succinct view while preserving the overall geometric structure. Given a dominant view plane for the structure, its curve skeleton is first projected to a 2D skeleton. This 2D skeleton is adjusted to account for distortions in length, modified to remove intersections, and optimized to preserve the shape of the original 3D skeleton. Based on this shaped 2D skeleton, a boundary for the map of the object is obtained based on a slicing path through the structure and the radius around the skeleton. The sliced structure is conformally mapped to a rectangle and then deformed via harmonic mapping to match the boundary placement. This flattened map preserves the general geometric context of a 3D object in a 2D display, and rendering of this flattened map can be accomplished using volumetric ray casting. We have evaluated our method on real datasets of human colon models.","Authors":"Marino, J.;Wei Zeng;Xianfeng Gu;Kaufman, A.","Clusters":"BiomedicalScienceAndMedicine;GeometryBasedTechniques;NumericalMethodsMathematics;VolumeRenderingModelingAndVisualization","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2011.182","Keywords":"volume rendering;conformal mapping;biomedical visualization;medical visualization;geometry-based technique","Keywords_Processed":"volume render;geometry base technique;biomedical visualization;conformal mapping;medical visualization","Title":"Context Preserving Maps of Tubular Structures"},"134":{"Abstract":"This paper presents two linked empirical studies focused on uncertainty visualization. The experiments are framed from two conceptual perspectives. First, a typology of uncertainty is used to delineate kinds of uncertainty matched with space, time, and attribute components of data. Second, concepts from visual semiotics are applied to characterize the kind of visual signification that is appropriate for representing those different categories of uncertainty. This framework guided the two experiments reported here. The first addresses representation intuitiveness, considering both visual variables and iconicity of representation. The second addresses relative performance of the most intuitive abstract and iconic representations of uncertainty on a map reading task. Combined results suggest initial guidelines for representing uncertainty and discussion focuses on practical applicability of results.","Authors":"MacEachren, A.M.;Roth, R.E.;O'Brien, J.;Li, B.;Swingley, D.;Gahegan, M.","Clusters":"SemanticsSemioticsRelatedTechniques;UncertaintyTechniquesAndVisualization;VisualEncodingAndLayoutGeneral","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2012.279","Keywords":"uncertainty categories;semiotics;visual variables;uncertainty visualization","Keywords_Processed":"semiotic;uncertainty visualization;uncertainty category;visual variable","Title":"Visual Semiotics & Uncertainty Visualization: An Empirical Study"},"226":{"Abstract":"We propose a new framework for visualising tables of counts, proportions and probabilities.

The goal is to enable a style of design with simulations that feels as-direct-as-possible so users can concentrate on creative design tasks. The approach integrates forward design via direct manipulation of simulation inputs (e.g., geometric properties, applied forces) in the same visual space with inverse design via 'tugging' and reshaping simulation outputs (e.g., scalar fields from finite element analysis (FEA) or computational fluid dynamics (CFD)). The interface includes algorithms for interpreting the intent of users' drag operations relative to parameterized models, morphing arbitrary scalar fields output from FEA and CFD simulations, and in-place interactive ensemble visualization. The inverse design strategy can be extended to use multi-touch input in combination with an as-rigid-as-possible shape manipulation to support rich visual queries. The potential of this new design approach is confirmed via two applications: medical device engineering of a vacuum-assisted biopsy device and visual effects design using a physically based flame simulation.","Authors":"Coffey, D.;Chi-Lun Lin;Erdman, A.G.;Keefe, D.F.","Clusters":"InteractionTechniquesGeneral;Simulation;VisualDesignDesignGuidelines","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2013.147","Keywords":"multi-touch;design;simulation;direct manipulation","Keywords_Processed":"multi touch;direct manipulation;simulation;design","Title":"Design by Dragging: An Interface for Creative Forward and Inverse Design with Simulation Ensembles"}}
