Bremer","Abstract":"With the recent advances in deep learning, neural network models have obtained state-of-the-art performances for many linguistic tasks in natural language processing. However, this rapid progress also brings enormous challenges. The opaque nature of a neural network model leads to hard-to-debug-systems and difficult-to-interpret mechanisms. Here, we introduce a visualization system that, through a tight yet flexible integration between visualization elements and the underlying model, allows a user to interrogate the model by perturbing the input, internal state, and prediction while observing changes in other parts of the pipeline. We use the natural language inference problem as an example to illustrate how a perturbation-driven paradigm can help domain experts assess the potential limitation of a model, probe its inner states, and interpret and form hypotheses about fundamental model mechanisms such as attention.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865230","Keywords":"Natural Language Processing;Interpretable Machine Learning;Natural Language Inference;Attention Visualization"},"1":{"Title":"Clique Community Persistence: A Topological Visual Analysis Approach for Complex Networks","Authors":"B. Rieck; U. Fugacci; J. Lukasczyk; H. Leitte","Abstract":"Complex networks require effective tools and visualizations for their analysis and comparison. Clique communities have been recognized as a powerful concept for describing cohesive structures in networks. We propose an approach that extends the computation of clique communities by considering persistent homology, a topological paradigm originally introduced to characterize and compare the global structure of shapes. Our persistence-based algorithm is able to detect clique communities and to keep track of their evolution according to different edge weight thresholds. We use this information to define comparison metrics and a new centrality measure, both reflecting the relevance of the clique communities inherent to the network. Moreover, we propose an interactive visualization tool based on nested graphs that is capable of compactly representing the evolving relationships between communities for different thresholds and clique degrees. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various network types.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744321","Keywords":"Persistent homology;topological persistence;cliques;complex networks;visual analysis"},"2":{"Title":"Time-Dependent Flow seen through Approximate Observer Killing Fields","Authors":"M. Hadwiger; M. Mlejnek; T. Theu\u00dfl; P. Rautek","Abstract":"Flow fields are usually visualized relative to a global observer, i.e., a single frame of reference. However, often no global frame can depict all flow features equally well. Likewise, objective criteria for detecting features such as vortices often use either a global reference frame, or compute a separate frame for each point in space and time. We propose the first general framework that enables choosing a smooth trade-off between these two extremes. Using global optimization to minimize specific differential geometric properties, we compute a time-dependent observer velocity field that describes the motion of a continuous field of observers adapted to the input flow. This requires developing the novel notion of an observed time derivative. While individual observers are restricted to rigid motions, overall we compute an approximate Killing field, corresponding to almost-rigid motion. This enables continuous transitions between different observers. Instead of focusing only on flow features, we furthermore develop a novel general notion of visualizing how all observers jointly perceive the input field. This in fact requires introducing the concept of an observation time, with respect to which a visualization is computed. We develop the corresponding notions of observed stream, path, streak, and time lines. For efficiency, these characteristic curves can be computed using standard approaches, by first transforming the input field accordingly. Finally, we prove that the input flow perceived by the observer field is objective. This makes derived flow features, such as vortices, objective as well.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864839","Keywords":"Flow visualization;observer frames of reference;Killing vector fields;infinitesimal isometries;Lie derivatives;objectivity"},"3":{"Title":"Robust Tracing and Visualization of Heterogeneous Microvascular Networks","Authors":"P.

G. Nonato; M. Aupetit","Abstract":"Visual analysis of multidimensional data requires expressive and effective ways to reduce data dimensionality to encode them visually. Multidimensional projections (MDP) figure among the most important visualization techniques in this context, transforming multidimensional data into scatter plots whose visual patterns reflect some notion of similarity in the original data. However, MDP come with distortions that make these visual patterns not trustworthy, hindering users to infer actual data characteristics. Moreover, the patterns present in the scatter plots might not be enough to allow a clear understanding of multidimensional data, motivating the development of layout enrichment methodologies to operate together with MDP. This survey attempts to cover the main aspects of MDP as a visualization and visual analytic tool. It provides detailed analysis and taxonomies as to the organization of MDP techniques according to their main properties and traits, discussing the impact of such properties for visual perception and other human factors. The survey also approaches the different types of distortions that can result from MDP mappings and it overviews existing mechanisms to quantitatively evaluate such distortions. A qualitative analysis of the impact of distortions on the different analytic tasks performed by users when exploring multidimensional data through MDP is also presented. Guidelines for choosing the best MDP for an intended task are also provided as a result of this analysis. Finally, layout enrichment schemes to debunk MDP distortions and\/or reveal relevant information not directly inferable from the scatter plot are reviewed and discussed in the light of new taxonomies. We conclude the survey providing future research axes to fill discovered gaps in this domain.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2846735","Keywords":"Multidimensional projection;dimensionality reduction;multidimensional scaling;error analysis;layout enrichment"},"5":{"Title":"The Martian: Examining Human Physical Judgments across Virtual Gravity Fields","Authors":"T.

We designed four virtual reality experiments with different tasks for participants to complete: strike a ball to hit a target, trigger a ball to hit a target, predict the landing location of a projectile, and estimate the flight duration of a projectile. The first two experiments compared human behavior in the virtual environment with real-world performance reported in the literature. The last two experiments aimed to test the human ability to adapt to novel gravity fields by measuring their performance in trajectory prediction and time estimation tasks. The experiment results show that: 1) based on brief observation of a projectile's initial trajectory, humans are accurate at predicting the landing location even under novel gravity fields, and 2) humans' time estimation in a familiar earth environment fluctuates around the ground truth flight duration, although the time estimation in unknown gravity fields indicates a bias toward earth's gravity.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2657235","Keywords":"Virtual reality;intuitive physics;mental simulation"},"6":{"Title":"SensePath: Understanding the Sensemaking Process Through Analytic Provenance","Authors":"P.

Understanding the sensemaking process allows building effective visual analytics tools to make sense of large and complex datasets. Currently, it is often a manual and time-consuming undertaking to comprehend this: researchers collect observation data, transcribe screen capture videos and think-aloud recordings, identify recurring patterns, and eventually abstract the sensemaking process into a general model. In this paper, we propose a general approach to facilitate such a qualitative analysis process, and introduce a prototype, SensePath, to demonstrate the application of this approach with a focus on browser-based online sensemaking. The approach is based on a study of a number of qualitative research sessions including observations of users performing sensemaking tasks and post hoc analyses to uncover their sensemaking processes. Based on the study results and a follow-up participatory design session with HCI researchers, we decided to focus on the transcription and coding stages of thematic analysis. SensePath automatically captures user's sensemaking actions, i.e., analytic provenance, and provides multi-linked views to support their further analysis. A number of other requirements elicited from the design session are also implemented in SensePath, such as easy integration with existing qualitative analysis workflow and non-intrusive for participants. The tool was used by an experienced HCI researcher to analyze two sensemaking sessions. The researcher found the tool intuitive and considerably reduced analysis time, allowing better understanding of the sensemaking process.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467611","Keywords":"Sensemaking;analytic provenance;transcription;coding;qualitative research;timeline visualization;Sensemaking;analytic provenance;transcription;coding;qualitative research;timeline visualization"},"7":{"Title":"SGaze: A Data-Driven Eye-Head Coordination Model for Realtime Gaze Prediction","Authors":"Z.

Precise registration and tracking has been a cumbersome and intrusive process in the past. In this paper, we present a new method for tracking complex-shaped physical objects interactively. In contrast to previous approaches our system is mobile and makes solely use of the projection of the virtual replication to track the physical object and \u201cstick\u201d the projection to it. Our method consists of two stages, a fast pose initialization based on structured light patterns and a non-intrusive frame-by-frame tracking based on features detected in the projection. During the tracking phase, a radiometrically corrected virtual camera view based on the current pose prediction is rendered and compared to the captured image. Matched features are triangulated providing a sparse set of surface points that is robustly aligned to the virtual model. The alignment transformation serves as an input for the new pose prediction. Detailed experiments including the evaluation of the overlay accuracy show that our approach can accurately and robustly track complex objects at interactive rates.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2450934","Keywords":"Computer Vision;Augmented Reality.;Computer vision;augmented reality"},"9":{"Title":"Continuous-Scale Kinetic Fluid Simulation","Authors":"W.

However, such approaches have not been widely adopted in graphics mainly due to the underlying inaccuracy, instability and inflexibility. In this paper, we try to tackle these problems in order to make kinetic approaches practical for graphical applications. To achieve more accurate and stable simulations, we propose to employ the non-orthogonal central-moment-relaxation model, where we develop a novel adaptive relaxation method to retain both stability and accuracy in turbulent flows. To achieve flexibility, we propose a novel continuous-scale formulation that enables samples at arbitrary resolutions to easily communicate with each other in a more continuous sense and with loose geometrical constraints, which allows efficient and adaptive sample construction to better match the physical scale. Such a capability directly leads to an automatic sample construction which generates static and dynamic scales at initialization and during simulation, respectively. This effectively makes our method suitable for simulating turbulent flows with arbitrary geometrical boundaries. Our simulation results with applications to smoke animations show the benefits of our method, with comparisons for justification and verification.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2859931","Keywords":"multi-resolution fluid simulation;lattice Boltzmann model;adaptive refinement"},"10":{"Title":"TargetVue: Visual Analysis of Anomalous User Behaviors in Online Communication Systems","Authors":"N. Cao; C. Shi; S. Lin; J. Lu; Y. Lin; C. Lin","Abstract":"Users with anomalous behaviors in online communication systems (e.g. email and social medial platforms) are potential threats to society. Automated anomaly detection based on advanced machine learning techniques has been developed to combat this issue; challenges remain, though, due to the difficulty of obtaining proper ground truth for model training and evaluation. Therefore, substantial human judgment on the automated analysis results is often required to better adjust the performance of anomaly detection. Unfortunately, techniques that allow users to understand the analysis results more efficiently, to make a confident judgment about anomalies, and to explore data in their context, are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel visual analysis system, TargetVue, which detects anomalous users via an unsupervised learning model and visualizes the behaviors of suspicious users in behavior-rich context through novel visualization designs and multiple coordinated contextual views. Particularly, TargetVue incorporates three new ego-centric glyphs to visually summarize a user's behaviors which effectively present the user's communication activities, features, and social interactions. An efficient layout method is proposed to place these glyphs on a triangle grid, which captures similarities among users and facilitates comparisons of behaviors of different users. We demonstrate the power of TargetVue through its application in a social bot detection challenge using Twitter data, a case study based on email records, and an interview with expert users. Our evaluation shows that TargetVue is beneficial to the detection of users with anomalous communication behaviors.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467196","Keywords":"Anomaly Detection;Social Media;Visual Analysis;Anomaly Detection;Social Media;Visual Analysis"},"11":{"Title":"Placenta Maps: In Utero Placental Health Assessment of the Human Fetus","Authors":"H.

Although it is currently the gold-standard in fetal imaging, it might not capture certain abnormalities of the placenta.

Nevertheless, there is currently no established procedure for assessing the condition of the placenta and consequently the fetal health. Due to maternal respiration and inherent movements of the fetus during examination, a quantitative assessment of the placenta requires fetal motion compensation, precise placenta segmentation and a standardized visualization, which are challenging tasks. Utilizing advanced motion compensation and automatic segmentation methods to extract the highly versatile shape of the placenta, we introduce a novel visualization technique that presents the fetal and maternal side of the placenta in a standardized way. Our approach enables physicians to explore the placenta even in utero. This establishes the basis for a comparative assessment of multiple placentas to analyze possible pathologic arrangements and to support the research and understanding of this vital organ. Additionally, we propose a three-dimensional structure-aware surface slicing technique in order to explore relevant regions inside the placenta.

Evolutionary patterns of ego-networks along time provide huge insights to many domains such as sociology, anthropology, and psychology. However, the analysis of dynamic ego-networks remains challenging due to its complicated time-varying graph structures, for example: alters come and leave, ties grow stronger and fade away, and alter communities merge and split. Most of the existing dynamic graph visualization techniques mainly focus on topological changes of the entire network, which is not adequate for egocentric analytical tasks. In this paper, we present egoSlider, a visual analysis system for exploring and comparing dynamic ego-networks. egoSlider provides a holistic picture of the data through multiple interactively coordinated views, revealing ego-network evolutionary patterns at three different layers: a macroscopic level for summarizing the entire ego-network data, a mesoscopic level for overviewing specific individuals' ego-network evolutions, and a microscopic level for displaying detailed temporal information of egos and their alters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of egoSlider with a usage scenario with the DBLP publication records. Also, a controlled user study indicates that in general egoSlider outperforms a baseline visualization of dynamic networks for completing egocentric analytical tasks.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2468151","Keywords":"Egocentric network;dynamic graph;network visualization;glyph-based design;visual analytics;Egocentric network;dynamic graph;network visualization;glyph-based design;visual analytics"},"13":{"Title":"Interactive 3D Visual Analysis of Atmospheric Fronts","Authors":"M.

In this work, we -a team of visualization scientists and meteorologists-propose a novel visualization approach to analyze the three-dimensional structure of atmospheric fronts and related physical and dynamical processes. We build upon existing approaches to objectively identify fronts as lines in two dimensions and extend these to obtain frontal surfaces in three dimensions, using the magnitude of temperature change along the gradient of a moist potential temperature field as the primary identifying factor. We introduce the use of normal curves in the temperature gradient field to visualize a frontal zone (i.e., the transitional zone between the air masses) and the distribution of atmospheric variables in such zones. To enable for the first time a statistical analysis of frontal zones, we present a new approach to obtain the volume enclosed by a zone, by classifying grid boxes that intersect with normal curves emanating from a selected front. We introduce our method by means of an idealized numerical simulation and demonstrate its use with two real-world cases using numerical weather prediction data.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864806","Keywords":"Meteorology;Atmospheric Fronts;Feature Detection"},"14":{"Title":"Enhancing Web-based Analytics Applications through Provenance","Authors":"A.

Understanding is enhanced when users can replay and revisit the steps in the sensemaking process, and in collaborative settings, it is especially important to be able to review not only the current state but also what decisions were made along the way.

Visualizing temporal data is inherently difficult, due to the many aspects that need to be communicated to the users (e.g., time and variable changes).

In this paper we propose popup-plots, a novel concept where the common interaction of 3D rotation is used to navigate through the data. This allows the users to view the data from different perspectives without having to learn and adapt to new interaction concepts. Popup-plots are therefore a novel method for visualizing and interacting with dependent variables over time. We extend 2D plots with the temporal information by bending the space according to the time. The bending is calculated based on a spherical coordinates approach, which is continuously influenced by the viewing direction towards the plot. Hence, the plot can be viewed from various angles with seamless transitions in between, offering the possibility to analyze different aspects of the represented data. As the current viewing direction is inherently depicted by the shape of the data, the users are able to deduce which part of the data is currently viewed.

The goals are twofold: First, make the process of creating real, animated, data-driven visualizations of complex information more accessible to artists, graphic designers, and other visual experts with traditional, non-technical training. Second, support and enhance the role of human creativity in visualization design, enabling visual experimentation and workflows similar to what is possible with traditional artistic media. The approach is to conceive of visualization design as a combination of processes that are already closely linked with visual creativity: sketching, digital painting, image editing, and reacting to exemplars. Rather than studying and tweaking low-level algorithms and their parameters, designers create new visualizations by painting directly on top of a digital data canvas, sketching data glyphs, and arranging and blending together multiple layers of animated 2D graphics.

Cui","Abstract":"As an ensemble model that consists of many independent decision trees, random forests generate predictions by feeding the input to internal trees and summarizing their outputs. The ensemble nature of the model helps random forests outperform any individual decision tree. However, it also leads to a poor model interpretability, which significantly hinders the model from being used in fields that require transparent and explainable predictions, such as medical diagnosis and financial fraud detection. The interpretation challenges stem from the variety and complexity of the contained decision trees. Each decision tree has its unique structure and properties, such as the features used in the tree and the feature threshold in each tree node. Thus, a data input may lead to a variety of decision paths. To understand how a final prediction is achieved, it is desired to understand and compare all decision paths in the context of all tree structures, which is a huge challenge for any users. In this paper, we propose a visual analytic system aiming at interpreting random forest models and predictions. In addition to providing users with all the tree information, we summarize the decision paths in random forests, which eventually reflects the working mechanism of the model and reduces users' mental burden of interpretation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, two usage scenarios and a qualitative user study are conducted.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864475","Keywords":"Interpretable Machine Learning;Random Forests;Random Forest Visualization;Visual Analytics"},"24":{"Title":"Unified Mathematical Model for Multilayer-Multiframe Compressive Light Field Displays Using LCDs","Authors":"J.

We show that the light field decomposition of such a display can be cast as a bound constrained nonlinear matrix optimization problem. Efficient light field decomposition algorithms are developed using the limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) method for automultiscopic displays with high resolution and high image fidelity. In addition, this framework is the first to support multilayer polarization-based compressive light field displays with time multiplexing. This new architecture significantly reduces artifacts compared with attenuation-based multilayer-multiframe displays; thus, it can allow the requirements regarding the number of layers or the refresh rate to be relaxed. We verify the proposed methods by constructing two 3-layer prototypes using high-speed LCDs, one based on the attenuation architecture and one based on the polarization architecture. Moreover, an efficient CUDA-based program is implemented. Our displays can produce images with higher spatial resolution with thinner form factors compared with traditional automultiscopic displays in both simulations and experiments.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2810279","Keywords":"Compressive light field display;multilayer-multiframe LCD display;optimization methods;polarization-based display"},"25":{"Title":"Visual Abstraction of Large Scale Geospatial Origin-Destination Movement Data","Authors":"Z. Zhou; L. Meng; C. Tang; Y. Zhao; Z. Guo; M. Hu; W.

A large number of techniques have been proposed to reduce visual clutter of flow maps, such as filtering, clustering and edge bundling, but the correlations of OD flows are often neglected, which makes the simplified OD flow map present little semantic information. In this paper, a characterization of OD flows is established based on an analogy between OD flows and natural language processing (NPL) terms. Then, an iterative multi-objective sampling scheme is designed to select OD flows in a vectorized representation space. To enhance the readability of sampled OD flows, a set of meaningful visual encodings are designed to present the interactions of OD flows. We design and implement a visual exploration system that supports visual inspection and quantitative evaluation from a variety of perspectives. Case studies based on real-world datasets and interviews with domain experts have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system in reducing the visual clutter and enhancing correlations of OD flows.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864503","Keywords":"Visual abstraction;human mobility;origin-destination;flow map;representation learning"},"26":{"Title":"Static\/Dynamic Filtering for Mesh Geometry","Authors":"J.

Existing methods either rely on a static guidance that may be inconsistent with the input and lead to unsatisfactory results, or a dynamic guidance that is automatically updated but sensitive to noises and outliers. Inspired by recent advances in image filtering, we propose a new geometry filtering technique called static\/dynamic filter, which utilizes both static and dynamic guidances to achieve state-of-the-art results. The proposed filter is based on a nonlinear optimization that enforces smoothness of the signal while preserving variations that correspond to features of certain scales. We develop an efficient iterative solver for the problem, which unifies existing filters that are based on static or dynamic guidances. The filter can be applied to mesh face normals followed by vertex position update, to achieve scale-aware and feature-preserving filtering of mesh geometry. It also works well for other types of signals defined on mesh surfaces, such as texture colors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter for various geometry processing applications such as mesh denoising, geometry feature enhancement, and texture color filtering.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2816926","Keywords":"Geometry processing;mesh filtering;mesh denoising"},"27":{"Title":"KnowledgePearls: Provenance-Based Visualization Retrieval","Authors":"H.

Hazarika; S. Dutta; H. Shen; J. Chen","Abstract":"CoDDA (Copula-based Distribution Driven Analysis) is a flexible framework for large-scale multivariate datasets. A common strategy to deal with large-scale scientific simulation data is to partition the simulation domain and create statistical data summaries. Instead of storing the high-resolution raw data from the simulation, storing the compact statistical data summaries results in reduced storage overhead and alleviated I\/O bottleneck. Such summaries, often represented in the form of statistical probability distributions, can serve various post-hoc analysis and visualization tasks. However, for multivariate simulation data using standard multivariate distributions for creating data summaries is not feasible. They are either storage inefficient or are computationally expensive to be estimated in simulation time (in situ) for large number of variables. In this work, using copula functions, we propose a flexible multivariate distribution-based data modeling and analysis framework that offers significant data reduction and can be used in an in situ environment. The framework also facilitates in storing the associated spatial information along with the multivariate distributions in an efficient representation. Using the proposed multivariate data summaries, we perform various multivariate post-hoc analyses like query-driven visualization and sampling-based visualization.

Identifying variables that correlate is a common practice to remove redundancy, but correlation varies across space, with scale and over time, and the frequently used global statistics hide potentially important differentiating local variation. For more comprehensive and robust insights into multivariate relations, these local correlations need to be assessed through various means of defining locality. We explore the geography of this issue, and use novel interactive visualization to identify interdependencies in multivariate data sets to support geographically informed multivariate analysis. We offer terminology for considering scale and locality, visual techniques for establishing the effects of scale on correlation and a theoretical framework through which variation in geographic correlation with scale and locality are addressed explicitly. Prototype software demonstrates how these contributions act together. These techniques enable multiple variables and their geographic characteristics to be considered concurrently as we extend visual parameter space analysis (vPSA) to the spatial domain. We find variable correlations to be sensitive to scale and geography to varying degrees in the context of energy-based geodemographics. This sensitivity depends upon the calculation of locality as well as the geographical and statistical structure of the variable.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467199","Keywords":"Scale;Geography;Multivariate;Sensitivity Analysis;Variable Selection;Local Statistics;Geodemographics;Energy;Scale;Geography;Multivariate;Sensitivity Analysis;Variable Selection;Local Statistics;Geodemographics;Energy"},"32":{"Title":"An Analysis of Automated Visual Analysis Classification: Interactive Visualization Task Inference of Cancer Genomics Domain Experts","Authors":"C.

For applications which require realistic representations of real world environments, the VEs need to provide multiple, physically accurate sensory stimuli. However, simulating all the senses that comprise the human sensory system (HSS) is a task that requires significant computational resources. Since it is intractable to deliver all senses at the highest quality, we propose a resource distribution scheme in order to achieve an optimal perceptual experience within the given computational budgets. This paper investigates resource balancing for multi-modal scenarios composed of aural, visual and olfactory stimuli. Three experimental studies were conducted. The first experiment identified perceptual boundaries for olfactory computation. In the second experiment, participants ($N=25$) were asked, across a fixed number of budgets ($M=5$), to identify what they perceived to be the best visual, acoustic and olfactory stimulus quality for a given computational budget. Results demonstrate that participants tend to prioritize visual quality compared to other sensory stimuli. However, as the budget size is increased, users prefer a balanced distribution of resources with an increased preference for having smell impulses in the VE. Based on the collected data, a quality prediction model is proposed and its accuracy is validated against previously unused budgets and an untested scenario in a third and final experiment.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2019.2898823","Keywords":"Multi-Modal;Cross-Modal;Tri-Modal;Sound;Graphics;Olfactory"},"34":{"Title":"A Perception-Driven Approach to Supervised Dimensionality Reduction for Visualization","Authors":"Y.

These issues make them ineffective for complicated class structures. Towards filling this gap, we present a perception-driven linear dimensionality reduction approach that maximizes the perceived class separation in projections. Our approach builds on recent developments in perception-based separation measures that have achieved good results in imitating human perception. We extend these measures to be density-aware and incorporate them into a customized simulated annealing algorithm, which can rapidly generate a near optimal DR projection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it to state-of-the-art DR methods on 93 datasets, using both quantitative measure and human judgments.

Morgand; M. Tamaazousti; A. Bartoli","Abstract":"Specularities are often problematic in computer vision since they impact the dynamic range of the image intensity. A natural approach would be to predict and discard them using computer graphics models. However, these models depend on parameters which are difficult to estimate (light sources, objects' material properties and camera). We present a geometric model called JOLIMAS: JOint LIght-MAterial Specularity, which predicts the shape of specularities. JOLIMAS is reconstructed from images of specularities observed on a planar surface. It implicitly includes light and material properties, which are intrinsic to specularities. This model was motivated by the observation that specularities have a conic shape on planar surfaces. The conic shape is obtained by projecting a fixed quadric on the planar surface. JOLIMAS thus predicts the specularity using a simple geometric approach with static parameters (object material and light source shape). It is adapted to indoor light sources such as light bulbs and fluorescent lamps. The prediction has been tested on synthetic and real sequences. It works in a multi-light context by reconstructing a quadric for each light source with special cases such as lights being switched on or off. We also used specularity prediction for dynamic retexturing and obtained convincing rendering results.

A key consideration in this paper is the construction of a cost function to capture several relevant aspects of the human visual system, examining a scatterplot design for some data analysis task.

The approach is extensible to different analysis tasks. To test its performance in a realistic setting, we pre-calibrated it for correlation estimation, class separation, and outlier detection.

Unfortunately, these devices usually require expensive optimizations to compute a suitable decomposition of the input light field or focal stack to drive individual display layers. Although these methods provide near-correct image reconstruction, a significant computational cost prevents real-time applications. A simple alternative is a linear blending strategy which decomposes a single 2D image using depth information. This method provides real-time performance, but it generates inaccurate results at occlusion boundaries and on glossy surfaces. This paper proposes a perception-based hybrid decomposition technique which combines the advantages of the above strategies and achieves both real-time performance and high-fidelity results. The fundamental idea is to apply expensive optimizations only in regions where it is perceptually superior, e.g., depth discontinuities at the fovea, and fall back to less costly linear blending otherwise. We present a complete, perception-informed analysis and model that locally determine which of the two strategies should be applied. The prediction is later utilized by our new synthesis method which performs the image decomposition. The results are analyzed and validated in user experiments on a custom multi-plane display.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2019.2898821","Keywords":"3D displays;Rendering;Accommodation;Perception"},"38":{"Title":"Adaptive Skinning for Interactive Hair-Solid Simulation","Authors":"M.

Unfortunately, hair-solid interactions is a pathological case for traditional reduced hair models, as the motion coherence between hair strands can be arbitrarily broken by interacting with solids. In this paper, we propose an adaptive hair skinning method for interactive hair simulation with hair-solid collisions. We precompute many eligible sets of guide hairs and the corresponding interpolation relationships that are represented using a compact strand-based hair skinning model. At runtime, we simulate only guide hairs; for interpolating every other hair, we adaptively choose its guide hairs, taking into account motion coherence and potential hair-solid collisions. Further, we introduce a two-way collision correction algorithm to allow sparsely sampled guide hairs to resolve collisions with solids that can have small geometric features. Our method enables interactive simulation of more than 150 K hair strands interacting with complex solid objects, using 400 guide hairs.

However, a hollowing operation can lead to additional supporting structures for fabrication in interior voids, which cannot be removed. As a consequence, the result of a hollowing operation is affected by these additional supporting structures when applying the operation to optimize physical properties of different models. This paper proposes a support-free hollowing framework to overcome the difficulty of fabricating voids inside a solid. The challenge of computing a support-free hollowing is decomposed into a sequence of shape optimization steps, which are repeatedly applied to interior mesh surfaces. The optimization of physical properties in different applications can be easily integrated into our framework. Comparing to prior approaches that can generate support-free inner structures, our hollowing operation can reduce more volume of material and thus provide a larger solution space for physical optimization.

So far there are no guidelines that indicate which of these visualization methods better display trends in time series for a given canvas. Assuming that the main information in a time series is its overall trend, we propose an algorithm that automatically picks the visualization method that reveals this trend best. This is achieved by measuring the visual consistency between the trend curve represented by a LOESS fit and the trend described by a scatter plot or a line graph. To measure the consistency between our algorithm and user choices, we performed an empirical study with a series of controlled experiments that show a large correspondence. In a factor analysis we furthermore demonstrate that various visual and data factors have effects on the preference for a certain type of visualization.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2653106","Keywords":"Line graph;scatter plot;time series;trend"},"47":{"Title":"GANViz: A Visual Analytics Approach to Understand the Adversarial Game","Authors":"J. Wang; L. Gou; H. Yang; H. Shen","Abstract":"Generative models bear promising implications to learn data representations in an unsupervised fashion with deep learning. Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) is one of the most popular frameworks in this arena. Despite the promising results from different types of GANs, in-depth understanding on the adversarial training process of the models remains a challenge to domain experts. The complexity and the potential long-time training process of the models make it hard to evaluate, interpret, and optimize them. In this work, guided by practical needs from domain experts, we design and develop a visual analytics system, GANViz, aiming to help experts understand the adversarial process of GANs in-depth. Specifically, GANViz evaluates the model performance of two subnetworks of GANs, provides evidence and interpretations of the models' performance, and empowers comparative analysis with the evidence. Through our case studies with two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that GANViz can provide useful insight into helping domain experts understand, interpret, evaluate, and potentially improve GAN models.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2816223","Keywords":"Generative adversarial nets;deep learning;model interpretation;visual analytics"},"48":{"Title":"Automatic Optimization of Wayfinding Design","Authors":"H.

Conventionally, the wayfinding design of a virtual environment is created manually, so as the wayfinding design of a real-world architectural site. The many possible navigation scenarios, as well as the interplay between signs and human navigation, can make the manual design process overwhelming and non-trivial. As a result, creating a wayfinding design for a typical layout can take months to several years. In this paper, we introduce the Way to Go! approach for automatically generating a wayfinding design for a given layout. The designer simply has to specify some navigation scenarios; our approach will automatically generate an optimized wayfinding design with signs properly placed considering human agents' visibility and possibility of making mistakes during a navigation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating wayfinding designs for different layouts such as a train station, a downtown and a canyon. We evaluate our results by comparing different wayfinding designs and show that our optimized wayfinding design can guide pedestrians to their destinations effectively and efficiently. Our approach can also help the designer visualize the accessibility of a destination from different locations, and correct any \u201cblind zone\u201d with additional signs.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2761820","Keywords":"Wayfinding;navigation;procedural modeling;level design;spatial orientation"},"49":{"Title":"Evaluating Multi-Dimensional Visualizations for Understanding Fuzzy Clusters","Authors":"Y.

In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to evaluate the ability of fuzzy clusters analysis to use four multi-dimensional visualization techniques, namely, parallel coordinate plot, scatterplot matrix, principal component analysis, and Radviz. First, we define the analytical tasks and their representative questions specific to fuzzy clusters analysis.

We also design subjective questionnaires to collect the experience of the volunteers with the four techniques in terms of ease of use, informativeness, and helpfulness.

This poses substantial challenge for level designers because the player's physical experience in a level will need to be considered, otherwise the level may turn out to be too exhausting or not challenging enough. This paper presents a novel approach to optimize level designs by considering the physical challenge imposed upon the player in completing a level of motion-based games. A game level is represented as an assembly of chunks characterized by the exercise intensity levels they impose on players. We formulate game level synthesis as an optimization problem, where the chunks are assembled in a way to achieve an optimized level of intensity. To allow the synthesis of game levels of varying lengths, we solve the trans-dimensional optimization problem with a Reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. We demonstrate that our approach can be applied to generate game levels for s of motion-based virtual reality games. A user evaluation validates the effectiveness of our approach in generating levels with the desired amount of physical challenge.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2793618","Keywords":"Virtual Reality;Level Design;Procedural Modeling;Exergaming"},"51":{"Title":"SmartCues: A Multitouch Query Approach for Details-on-Demand through Dynamically Computed Overlays","Authors":"H. Subramonyam; E. Adar","Abstract":"Details-on-demand is a crucial feature in the visual information-seeking process but is often only implemented in highly constrained settings. The most common solution, hover queries (i.e., tooltips), are fast and expressive but are usually limited to single mark (e.g., a bar in a bar chart). `Queries' to retrieve details for more complex sets of objects (e.g., comparisons between pairs of elements, averages across multiple items, trend lines, etc.) are difficult for end-users to invoke explicitly. Further, the output of these queries require complex annotations and overlays which need to be displayed and dismissed on demand to avoid clutter. In this work we introduce SmartCues, a library to support details-on-demand through dynamically computed overlays. For end-users, SmartCues provides multitouch interactions to construct complex queries for a variety of details. For designers, SmartCues offers an interaction library that can be used out-of-the-box, and can be extended for new charts and detail types. We demonstrate how SmartCues can be implemented across a wide array of visualization types and, through a lab study, show that end users can effectively use SmartCues.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865231","Keywords":"Graphical overlays;details-on-demand;graph comprehension"},"52":{"Title":"Generic Content-Based Retrieval of Marker-Based Motion Capture Data","Authors":"N.

The distance between two motion signatures is computed by a weighted sum of differences in separate features contained in them. For maximum retrieval performance, we propose a method to pre-learn an optimal set of weights for each type of motion in the database through biased discriminant analysis, and adaptively choose a good set of weights for any given query at the run time.

Hence, there is a need for studies that support corresponding decision making. Here, we investigate curvature estimation based on two discrete representations-volume images and triangle meshes-and present a comprehensive cross-comparison. For doing so, four carefully selected geometries, represented as implicit functions, have been discretized to volume images and triangle meshes in different resolutions on a comparable scale. Afterwards, implementations available in open-source libraries (CGAL, DIPimage, libigl, trimesh2, VTK) and our own implementation of a relevant paper [1] were applied to them and the resulting estimations of mean and Gaussian curvature were compared in terms of quality and runtime. Independent of the underlying discrete representation, all estimators generated similar errors, but overall, mesh-based methods allowed for more accurate estimations. We measured a maximum normalized mean absolute error difference of 6.36 percent between the most precise mesh-based method compared to corresponding image-based methods when considering only discretizations of sufficient resolution. In terms of runtime, methods working on triangle meshes were faster when geometries had a small surface density. For geometries with larger surface densities, which is fairly common when considering real data, e.g., in material or medical science, the runtimes for both representations were similar.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2861007","Keywords":"Differential geometry;mean curvature;Gaussian curvature;curvature estimation;volume image;triangle mesh"},"55":{"Title":"Rendering Rough Opaque Materials with Interfaced Lambertian Microfacets","Authors":"D.

They are generally combined with a Lambertian term to account for the colored aspect. These representations make use of the Fresnel reflectance factor at the interface, but the transmission factor at the interface should also be managed. One solution is to employ a multi-layered model with a single layer for the rough interface, which requires a numerical simulation for handling the multiple reflections of light between the substrate and the interface. In this paper, we propose rather to use a representation corresponding to a Fresnel interface lying on a Lambertian substrate, for which the multiple reflections of light between the interface and the substrate can be expressed analytically. With this interfaced Lambertian model, we show how Fresnel transmission affects the material appearance for flat and rough surfaces with isotropic and anisotropic distributions, that produce light backscattering effects. We also propose a methodology for using such materials in any physically based Monte Carlo rendering system, as well as an approximate representation, suitable for GPU applications or measured data fitting. Our approach generalizes several previous models, including flat Lambertian materials as well as specular and Lambertian microfacets.

However, previous methods usually ignore the influences of the different solid combustibles, leading to unrealistic sounding results. This paper proposes SSC (sounding solid combustibles), which is a new recording-driven non-premixed flame sound synthesis framework accounting for different solid combustibles. SSC consists of three components: combustion noise, vortex noise and popping sounds. The popping sounds are the keys to distinguish the differences of solid combustibles. To improve the quality of fire sound, we extract the features of popping sounds from the real fire sound examples based on modified Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. Unlike previous methods, we take both direct combustion noise and vortex noise into account because the fire model is non-premixed flame. In our method, we also greatly resolve the synchronization problem during blending the three components of SSC. Due to the introduction of the popping sounds, it is easy to distinguish the fire sounds of different solid combustibles by our method, with great potential in practical applications such as games, VR system, etc. Various experiments and comparisons are presented to validate our method.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2642958","Keywords":"Non-premixed fire sound;solid combustibles;direct combustion noise;vortex noise;popping sounds"},"57":{"Title":"Animation Plans for Before-and-After Satellite Images","Authors":"M.

Lavou\u00e9; M. Langer; A. Peytavie; P. Poulin","Abstract":"Lossy texture compression is increasingly used to reduce GPU memory and bandwidth consumption. However, as raised by recent studies, evaluating the quality of compressed textures is a difficult problem. Indeed using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) on texture images, like done in most applications, may not be a correct way to proceed. In particular, there is evidence that masking effects apply when the texture image is mapped on a surface and combined with other textures (e.g., affecting geometry or normal). These masking effects have to be taken into account when compressing a set of texture maps, in order to have a real understanding of the visual impact of the compression artifacts on the rendered images. In this work, we present the first psychophysical experiment investigating the perceptual impact of texture compression on rendered images. We explore the influence of compression bit rate, light direction, and diffuse and normal map content on the visual impact of artifacts. The collected data reveal huge masking effects from normal map to diffuse map artifacts and vice versa, and reveal the weakness of PSNR applied on individual textures for evaluating compression quality. The results allow us to also analyze the performance and failures of image quality metrics for predicting the visibility of these artifacts. We finally provide some recommendations for evaluating the quality of texture compression and show a practical application to approximating the distortion measured on a rendered 3D shape.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2805355","Keywords":"Texture compression;psychophysical experiment;image quality assessment;diffuse map;normal map"},"59":{"Title":"Turbulent Micropolar SPH Fluids with Foam","Authors":"J. Bender; D. Koschier; T. Kugelstadt; M. Weiler","Abstract":"In this paper we introduce a novel micropolar material model for the simulation of turbulent inviscid fluids. The governing equations are solved by using the concept of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). As already investigated in previous works, SPH fluid simulations suffer from numerical diffusion which leads to a lower vorticity, a loss in turbulent details and finally in less realistic results. To solve this problem we propose a micropolar fluid model. The micropolar fluid model is a generalization of the classical Navier-Stokes equations, which are typically used in computer graphics to simulate fluids. In contrast to the classical Navier-Stokes model, micropolar fluids have a microstructure and therefore consider the rotational motion of fluid particles. In addition to the linear velocity field these fluids also have a field of microrotation which represents existing vortices and provides a source for new ones. However, classical micropolar materials are viscous and the translational and the rotational motion are coupled in a dissipative way. Since our goal is to simulate turbulent fluids, we introduce a novel modified micropolar material for inviscid fluids with a non-dissipative coupling. Our model can generate realistic turbulences, is linear and angular momentum conserving, can be easily integrated in existing SPH simulation methods and its computational overhead is negligible. Another important visual feature of turbulent liquids is foam. Therefore, we present a post-processing method which considers microrotation in the foam particle generation. It works completely automatic and requires only one user-defined parameter to control the amount of foam.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2832080","Keywords":"Smoothed particle hydrodynamics;micropolar fluids;turbulence;incompressible fluids;foam"},"60":{"Title":"An Interactive Method to Improve Crowdsourced Annotations","Authors":"S.

In a spatial context, these summary displays have the drawback that when uncertainty is encoded via a spatial spread, display glyph area increases in size with prediction uncertainty. This increase can be easily confounded with an increase in the size, strength or other attribute of the phenomenon being presented. We argue that by directly displaying a carefully chosen subset of a prediction ensemble, so that uncertainty is conveyed implicitly, such misinterpretations can be avoided. Since such a display does not require uncertainty annotation, an information channel remains available for encoding additional information about the prediction. We demonstrate these points in the context of hurricane prediction visualizations, showing how we avoid occlusion of selected ensemble elements while preserving the spatial statistics of the original ensemble, and how an explicit encoding of uncertainty can also be constructed from such a selection. We conclude with the results of a cognitive experiment demonstrating that the approach can be used to construct storm prediction displays that significantly reduce the confounding of uncertainty with storm size, and thus improve viewers' ability to estimate potential for storm damage.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2607204","Keywords":"Implicit uncertainty presentation;ensembles;ensemble visualization;sampling;uncertainty;hurricane prediction"},"68":{"Title":"High-Quality Ultra-Compact Grid Layout of Grouped Networks","Authors":"V.

Improvements to these pipeline techniques, especially for orthogonal-style layout, are difficult and practical results have been slight in recent years. Yet, as discussed in this paper, there remain significant issues in the quality of the layouts produced by these techniques, even for quite small networks. This is especially true when layout with additional grouping constraints is required. The first contribution of this paper is to investigate an ultra-compact, grid-like network layout aesthetic that is motivated by the grid arrangements that are used almost universally by designers in typographical layout. Since the time when these heuristic and pipeline-based graph-layout methods were conceived, generic technologies (MIP, CP and SAT) for solving combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization problems have improved massively. The second contribution of this paper is to reassess whether these techniques can be used for high-quality layout of small graphs. While they are fast enough for graphs of up to 50 nodes we found these methods do not scale up.

There are, however, some barriers to adoption that must be addressed, such as that of motion sickness - which can lead to undesirable symptoms including postural instability, headaches, and nausea. Motion sickness in virtual reality occurs as a result of moving visual stimuli that cause users to perceive self-motion while they remain stationary in the real world. There are several contributing factors to both this perception of motion and the subsequent onset of sickness, including field of view, motion velocity, and stimulus depth. We verify first that differences in vection due to relative stimulus depth remain correlated with sickness. Then, we build a dataset of stereoscopic 3D videos and their corresponding sickness ratings in order to quantify their nauseogenicity, which we make available for future use. Using this dataset, we train a machine learning algorithm on hand-crafted features (quantifying speed, direction, and depth as functions of time) from each video, learning the contributions of these various features to the sickness ratings. Our predictor generally outperforms a na\u00efve estimate, but is ultimately limited by the size of the dataset.

In this paper, we present a novel association analysis method that guides visual exploration of scalar-level associations in the multivariate context. We model the directional interactions between scalars of different variables as information flows based on association rules. We introduce the concepts of informativeness and uniqueness to describe how information flows between scalars of different variables and how they are associated with each other in the multivariate domain. Based on scalar-level associations represented by a probabilistic association graph, we propose the Multi-Scalar Informativeness-Uniqueness (MSIU) algorithm to evaluate the informativeness and uniqueness of scalars. We present an exploration framework with multiple interactive views to explore the scalars of interest with confident associations in the multivariate spatial domain, and provide guidelines for visual exploration using our framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach through case studies using three representative multivariate scientific data sets.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467431","Keywords":"Multivariate data;association analysis;visual exploration;multiple views"},"71":{"Title":"Revisiting Stress Majorization as a Unified Framework for Interactive Constrained Graph Visualization","Authors":"Y.

Our approach is developed from the two-phase lattice Boltzmann method with the mean field model, which provides a unified framework for interface dynamics but is numerically unstable under turbulent conditions. Considering the drawbacks of the existing approaches, we propose techniques to suppress oscillations for significant stability enhancement, as well as derive a new subgrid-scale model to further improve stability, faithfully preserving liquid-air interface details without excessive diffusion by taking into account the density variation. The whole framework is highly parallel, enabling very efficient implementation.

Characterizing the large scale universe is essential to our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies. The density range of clusters, walls and voids are relatively well separated, when compared to filaments, which span a relatively larger range. The large scale filamentary network thus forms an intricate part of the cosmic web. In this paper, we describe Felix, a topology based framework for visual exploration of filaments in the cosmic web. The filamentary structure is represented by the ascending manifold geometry of the 2-saddles in the Morse-Smale complex of the density field. We generate a hierarchy of Morse-Smale complexes and query for filaments based on the density ranges at the end points of the filaments. The query is processed efficiently over the entire hierarchical Morse-Smale complex, allowing for interactive visualization. We apply Felix to computer simulations based on the heuristic Voronoi kinematic model and the standard ACDM cosmology, and demonstrate its usefulness through two case studies. First, we extract cosmic filaments within and across cluster like regions in Voronoi kinematic simulation datasets. We demonstrate that we produce similar results to existing structure finders. Second, we extract different classes of filaments based on their density characteristics from the ACDM simulation datasets. Filaments that form the spine of the cosmic web, which exist in high density regions in the current epoch, are isolated using Felix. Also, filaments present in void-like regions are isolated and visualized. These filamentary structures are often over shadowed by higher density range filaments and are not easily characterizable and extractable using other filament extraction methodologies.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2452919","Keywords":"Morse-Smale complexes;tessellations;cosmology theory;cosmic web;large-scale structure of the universe;Morse-Smale complexes;tessellations;cosmology theory;cosmic web;large-scale structure of the universe"},"77":{"Title":"Distribution Driven Extraction and Tracking of Features for Time-varying Data Analysis","Authors":"S.

Feature extraction and tracking are two important tasks scientists rely upon to get insights about the dynamic nature of the large scale time-varying data. However, often the complexity of the scientific phenomena only allows scientists to vaguely define their feature of interest. Furthermore, such features can have varying motion patterns and dynamic evolution over time. As a result, automatic extraction and tracking of features becomes a non-trivial task. In this work, we investigate these issues and propose a distribution driven approach which allows us to construct novel algorithms for reliable feature extraction and tracking with high confidence in the absence of accurate feature definition. We exploit two key properties of an object, motion and similarity to the target feature, and fuse the information gained from them to generate a robust feature-aware classification field at every time step. Tracking of features is done using such classified fields which enhances the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

Doing so avoids expensive safeguards against the domain coupling and improves the numerical robustness under large deformations. We present an algorithm that efficiently computes weight functions for reduced DOFs in a physics-aware manner.

In particular, we estimate the tangent directions, which serve as the tangent frame for anisotropic bidirectional reflectance distribution functions. Moreover, we exploit the ratio of the eigenvalues to measure the magnitude of the anisotropy at each shading point. Altogether, this allows us to model a data-driven, smooth transition from isotropic to strongly anisotropic volume shading. In this way, the shape of volumetric features can be enhanced significantly by aligning specular highlights along the principal direction of anisotropy. Our algorithm is independent of the transfer function, which allows us to compute all shading parameters once and store them with the data set.

To study the dependency among attributes, which need not be linear, we extend and compute the mutual information (MI) among attributes over time.

This effort facilitates keeping artworks current and translating them to different forms for diverse audiences. Chinese ink paintings and Japanese Sumies are well recognized in Western cultures, yet not easily practiced due to the years of training required. We are motivated to develop an interactive system for artists, non-artists, Asians, and non-Asians to enjoy the unique style of Chinese paintings. In this paper, our focus is on replacing static water flow scenes with animations. We include flow patterns, surface ripples, and water wakes which are challenging not only artistically but also algorithmically. We develop a data-driven system that procedurally computes a flow field based on stroke properties extracted from the painting, and animate water flows artistically and stylishly. Technically, our system first extracts water-flow-portraying strokes using their locations, oscillation frequencies, brush patterns, and ink densities. We construct an initial flow pattern by analyzing stroke structures, ink dispersion densities, and placement densities. We cluster extracted strokes as stroke pattern groups to further convey the spirit of the original painting. Then, the system automatically computes a flow field according to the initial flow patterns, water boundaries, and flow obstacles. Finally, our system dynamically generates and animates extracted stroke pattern groups with the constructed field for controllable smoothness and temporal coherence. The users can interactively place the extracted stroke patterns through our adapted Poisson-based composition onto other paintings for water flow animation. In conclusion, our system can visually transform a static Chinese painting to an interactive walk-through with seamless and vivid stroke-based flow animations in its original dynamic spirits without flickering artifacts.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2622269","Keywords":"NPR;data-driven;chinese ink painting;tensor field smoothing;naiver-stokes equations"},"83":{"Title":"TimeNotes: A Study on Effective Chart Visualization and Interaction Techniques for Time-Series Data","Authors":"J.

The great complexity of these structures, in particular, those of RNA, demands interactive visualization to get deeper insights into the relationship between the 2D secondary structure motifs and their 3D tertiary structures. Over the last decades, a lot of research in molecular visualization has focused on the visual exploration of protein structures while nucleic acids have only been marginally addressed. In contrast to proteins, which are composed of amino acids, the ingredients of nucleic acids are nucleotides. They form structuring patterns that differ from those of proteins and, hence, also require different visualization and exploration techniques.

Recent grasping techniques incorporate visual cues to help resolve undesirable visual or performance artifacts encountered after real fingers enter a virtual object. Prior guidelines about such visuals are based largely on other interaction types and provide inconsistent and potentially-misleading information when applied to grasping. We address this with a two-stage study. In the first stage, users adjusted parameters of various feedback types, including some novel aspects, to identify promising settings and to give insight into preferences regarding the parameters. In the next stage, the tuned feedback techniques were evaluated in terms of objective performance (finger penetration, release time, and precision) and subjective rankings (visual quality, perceived behavior impact, and overall preference). Additionally, subjects commented on the techniques while reviewing them in a final session. Performance wise, the most promising techniques directly reveal penetrating hand configuration in some way. Subjectively, subjects appreciated visual cues about interpenetration or grasp force, and color changes are most promising. The results enable selection of the best cues based on understanding the relevant tradeoffs and reasonable parameter values. The results also provide a needed basis for more focused studies of specific visual cues and for choosing conditions in comparisons to other feedback modes, such as haptic, audio, or multimodal.

In such a state, superfluid vortices exist as phase singularities of the model equation with unique distributions. This paper presents novel techniques to aid the visual understanding of superfluid vortices based on the state-of-the-art non-linear Klein-Gordon equation, which evolves a complex scalar field, giving rise to special vortex lattice\/ring structures with dynamic vortex formation, reconnection, and Kelvin waves, etc. By formulating a numerical model with theoretical physicists in superfluid research, we obtain high-quality superfluid flow data sets without noise-like waves, suitable for vortex visualization. By further exploring superfluid vortex properties, we develop a new vortex identification and visualization method: a novel mechanism with velocity circulation to overcome phase singularity and an orthogonal-plane strategy to avoid ambiguity. Hence, our visualizations can help reveal various superfluid vortex structures and enable domain experts for related visual analysis, such as the steady vortex lattice\/ring structures, dynamic vortex string interactions with reconnections and energy radiations, where the famous Kelvin waves and decaying vortex tangle were clearly observed. These visualizations have assisted physicists to verify the superfluid model, and further explore its dynamic behavior more intuitively.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2719684","Keywords":"Superfluid dynamics;vortex structure;visual analysis"},"97":{"Title":"FaceForge: Markerless Non-Rigid Face Multi-Projection Mapping","Authors":"C.

Due to the complexity of this time-varying data, advanced visualization techniques are required to support its visual analysis. Current molecular visualization techniques utilize ambient occlusion as a global illumination approximation to improve spatial comprehension. Besides these shadow-like effects, interreflections are also known to improve the spatial comprehension of complex geometric structures. Unfortunately, the inherent computational complexity of interreflections would forbid interactive exploration, which is mandatory in many scenarios dealing with static and time-varying data.

A human factors study was conducted to evaluate the relative effectiveness of these methods when applied to dynamically changing pseudo-terrain surfaces. The results indicate that, while no technique is most effective for all cases, contour lines generally perform best, and that the pseudo-contour lines induced by banded color scales convey the same benefits.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467962","Keywords":"Structured textures;terrain;deformation;dynamic surfaces;Structured textures;terrain;deformation;dynamic surfaces"},"102":{"Title":"PhenoBlocks: Phenotype Comparison Visualizations","Authors":"M.

However, constructing and rendering multiperspective visualizations is challenging. We present a framework for designing multiperspective focus+context visualizations with great flexibility by manipulating the underlying camera model. The focus region viewpoint is adapted to alleviate occlusions. The framework supports multiperspective visualization in three scenarios. In a first scenario, the viewpoint is altered independently for individual image regions to avoid occlusions. In a second scenario, conventional input images are connected into a multiperspective image. In a third scenario, one or several data subsets of interest (i.e., targets) are visualized where they would be seen in the absence of occluders, as the user navigates or the targets move. The multiperspective images are rendered at interactive rates, leveraging the camera model's fast projection operation.

In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely \u201cVA-assisted ML\u201d. The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864838","Keywords":"Visual Analytics;Visualization;Machine Learning;Human-Computer Interaction;Ontology;VIS4ML"},"105":{"Title":"StreamMap: Smooth Dynamic Visualization of High-Density Streaming Points","Authors":"C.

To better visualize and interact with inter-stream patterns, it is generally necessary to smooth out gaps or distortions in the streaming data. Previous approaches either animate the points directly or present a sampled static heat-map. We propose a new approach, called StreamMap, to smoothly blend high-density streaming points and create a visual flow that emphasizes the density pattern distributions. In essence, we present three new contributions for the visualization of high-density streaming points. The first contribution is a density-based method called super kernel density estimation that aggregates streaming points using an adaptive kernel to solve the overlapping problem. The second contribution is a robust density morphing algorithm that generates several smooth intermediate frames for a given pair of frames. The third contribution is a trend representation design that can help convey the flow directions of the streaming points. The experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of StreamMap when dynamic visualization and visual analysis of trend patterns on streaming points are required.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2668409","Keywords":"Information visualization;trend visualization;streaming data;density map;time-varying;scatterplots"},"106":{"Title":"ADMM $\\supseteq$ Projective Dynamics: Fast Simulation of Hyperelastic Models with Dynamic Constraints","Authors":"M.

Based on the 2D stroke, we identify a 3D seeding curve and generate a stream surface that captures the flow pattern of streamlines at the outermost layer. Then, we remove the streamlines whose patterns are covered by the stream surface. Repeating this process, users can peel the flow by replacing the streamlines with customized surfaces layer by layer. Furthermore, we propose an optimization scheme to identify the optimal seeding curve in the neighborhood of an original seeding curve based on surface quality measures. To support interactive optimization, we design a parallel surface quality estimation strategy that estimates the quality of a seeding curve without generating the surface.

We present a novel approach for generating a texture-mapped high-relief model from a single brush painting. Our aim is to extract the brushstrokes from a painting and generate the individual corresponding relief proxies rather than recovering the exact depth map from the painting, which is a tricky computer vision problem, requiring assumptions that are rarely satisfied. The relief proxies of brushstrokes are then combined together to form a 2.5D high-relief model. To extract brushstrokes from 2D paintings, we apply layer decomposition and stroke segmentation by imposing boundary constraints. The segmented brushstrokes preserve the style of the input painting. By inflation and a displacement map of each brushstroke, the features of brushstrokes are preserved by the resultant high-relief model of the painting. We demonstrate that our approach is able to produce convincing high-reliefs from a variety of paintings(with humans, animals, flowers, etc.). As a secondary application, we show how our brushstroke extraction algorithm could be used for image editing. As a result, our brushstroke extraction algorithm is specifically geared towards paintings with each brushstroke drawn very purposefully, such as Chinese paintings, Rosemailing paintings, etc.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2860004","Keywords":"Brush painting;brushstroke;layer decomposition;displacement mapping;high-relief"},"109":{"Title":"Mapping Color to Meaning in Colormap Data Visualizations","Authors":"K. B. Schloss; C. C. Gramazio; A. T. Silverman; M. L. Parker; A. S. Wang","Abstract":"To interpret data visualizations, people must determine how visual features map onto concepts. For example, to interpret colormaps, people must determine how dimensions of color (e.g., lightness, hue) map onto quantities of a given measure (e.g., brain activity, correlation magnitude). This process is easier when the encoded mappings in the visualization match people's predictions of how visual features will map onto concepts, their inferred mappings. To harness this principle in visualization design, it is necessary to understand what factors determine people's inferred mappings. In this study, we investigated how inferred color-quantity mappings for colormap data visualizations were influenced by the background color. Prior literature presents seemingly conflicting accounts of how the background color affects inferred color-quantity mappings. The present results help resolve those conflicts, demonstrating that sometimes the background has an effect and sometimes it does not, depending on whether the colormap appears to vary in opacity. When there is no apparent variation in opacity, participants infer that darker colors map to larger quantities (dark-is-more bias). As apparent variation in opacity increases, participants become biased toward inferring that more opaque colors map to larger quantities (opaque-is-more bias). These biases work together on light backgrounds and conflict on dark backgrounds. Under such conflicts, the opaque-is-more bias can negate, or even supersede the dark-is-more bias. The results suggest that if a design goal is to produce colormaps that match people's inferred mappings and are robust to changes in background color, it is beneficial to use colormaps that will not appear to vary in opacity on any background color, and to encode larger quantities in darker colors.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865147","Keywords":"Visual Reasoning;Visual Communication;Colormaps;Color Perception;Visual Encoding;Visual Design"},"110":{"Title":"Drone-Augmented Human Vision: Exocentric Control for Drones Exploring Hidden Areas","Authors":"O.

However, flight control from an egocentric view in narrow or constrained environments can be challenging. Arguably, an exocentric view would afford a better overview and, thus, more intuitive flight control of the drone. Unfortunately, such an exocentric view is unavailable when exploring indoor environments. This paper investigates the potential of drone-augmented human vision, i.e., of exploring the environment and controlling the drone indirectly from an exocentric viewpoint. If used with a see-through display, this approach can simulate X-ray vision to provide a natural view into an otherwise occluded environment. The user's view is synthesized from a three-dimensional reconstruction of the indoor environment using image-based rendering. This user interface is designed to reduce the cognitive load of the drone's flight control. The user can concentrate on the exploration of the inaccessible space, while flight control is largely delegated to the drone's autopilot system.

We analyze the impact of data uncertainty on topology and geometry extraction algorithms. A novel, edge-crossing probability based approach is proposed to predict underlying isosurface topology for uncertain data. We derive a probabilistic version of the midpoint decider that resolves ambiguities that arise in identifying topological configurations. Moreover, the probability density function characterizing positional uncertainty in isosurfaces is derived analytically for a broad class of nonparametric distributions. This analytic characterization can be used for efficient closed-form computation of the expected value and variation in geometry.

However, these methods either lack a perceptual foundation or heavily rely on intermediate isoline representations, which depend on choosing the right isovalues and are time-consuming to compute. This paper introduces a general image-based approach for selecting aspect ratios for a wide variety of 2D diagrams, ranging from scatter plots and density function plots to line charts. Our approach is derived from Federer's co-area formula and a line integral representation that enable us to directly construct image-based versions of existing selection methods using density fields. In contrast to previous methods, our approach bypasses isoline computation, so it is faster to compute, while following the perceptual foundation to select aspect ratios. Furthermore, this approach is complemented by an anisotropic kernel density estimation to construct density fields, allowing us to more faithfully characterize data patterns, such as the subgroups in scatterplots or dense regions in time series. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by quantitatively comparing to previous methods and revisiting a prior user study.

Visualization can support this process but, although there are many examples of systems for visual parameter analysis, there remains a need to systematically assess users' requirements and match those requirements to exemplar visualization methods. This article presents a new characterization of the requirements for pipeline design and optimization. This characterization is based on both a review of the literature and first-hand assessment of eight application case studies. We also match these requirements with exemplar functionality provided by existing visualization tools. Thus, we provide end-users and visualization developers with a way of identifying functionality that addresses data processing problems in an application. We also identify seven future challenges for visualization research that are not met by the capabilities of today's systems.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2603178","Keywords":"Visualization systems;requirement analysis;data processing pipelines"},"121":{"Title":"Personalized Exposure Control Using Adaptive Metering and Reinforcement Learning","Authors":"H. Yang; B. Wang; N. Vesdapunt; M. Guo; S. B. Kang","Abstract":"We propose a reinforcement learning approach for real-time exposure control of a mobile camera that is personalizable. Our approach is based on Markov Decision Process (MDP). In the camera viewfinder or live preview mode, given the current frame, our system predicts the change in exposure so as to optimize the trade-off among image quality, fast convergence, and minimal temporal oscillation. We model the exposure prediction function as a fully convolutional neural network that can be trained through Gaussian policy gradient in an end-to-end fashion. As a result, our system can associate scene semantics with exposure values; it can also be extended to personalize the exposure adjustments for a user and device. We improve the learning performance by incorporating an adaptive metering module that links semantics with exposure. This adaptive metering module generalizes the conventional spot or matrix metering techniques. We validate our system using the MIT FiveK [1] and our own datasets captured using iPhone 7 and Google Pixel. Experimental results show that our system exhibits stable real-time behavior while improving visual quality compared to what is achieved through native camera control.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865555","Keywords":"Auto exposure;reinforcement learning;personalization"},"122":{"Title":"In Pursuit of Error: A Survey of Uncertainty Visualization Evaluation","Authors":"J. Hullman; X. Qiao; M. Correll; A. Kale; M. Kay","Abstract":"Understanding and accounting for uncertainty is critical to effectively reasoning about visualized data. However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difficulties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of defining correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difficulties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality. We conclude with a concrete set of recommendations for evaluators designed to reduce the mismatch between the conceptualization of uncertainty in visualization versus other fields.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864889","Keywords":"Uncertainty visualization;user study;subjective confidence;probability distribution"},"123":{"Title":"Reactive Vega: A Streaming Dataflow Architecture for Declarative Interactive Visualization","Authors":"A.

For example, a movie may be associated with multiple genres with different levels of confidence. Despite their ubiquity, the problem of visualizing probabilistic labels has not been adequately addressed. Existing approaches often either discard the probabilistic information, or map the data to a low-dimensional subspace where their associations with original labels are obscured. In this paper, we propose a novel visual technique, UnTangle Map, for visualizing probabilistic multi-labels. In our proposed visualization, data items are placed inside a web of connected triangles, with labels assigned to the triangle vertices such that nearby labels are more relevant to each other. The positions of the data items are determined based on the probabilistic associations between items and labels. UnTangle Map provides both (a) an automatic label placement algorithm, and (b) adaptive interactions that allow users to control the label positioning for different information needs. Our work makes a unique contribution by providing an effective way to investigate the relationship between data items and their probabilistic labels, as well as the relationships among labels. Our user study suggests that the visualization effectively helps users discover emergent patterns and compare the nuances of probabilistic information in the data labels.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2424878","Keywords":"Visualization;Multidimensional Visualization;Probability Vector;Visualization;multidimensional visualization;probability vector"},"125":{"Title":"The Effect of Realistic Appearance of Virtual Characters in Immersive Environments - Does the Character's Personality Play a Role?","Authors":"K.

This effect, described as the uncanny valley, is the reason why realism is often avoided when the aim is to create an appealing virtual character. In Virtual Reality, there have been few attempts to investigate this phenomenon and the implications of rendering virtual characters with high levels of realism on user enjoyment. In this paper, we conducted a large-scale experiment on over one thousand members of the public in order to gather information on how virtual characters are perceived in interactive virtual reality games. We were particularly interested in whether different render styles (realistic, cartoon, etc.) would directly influence appeal, or if a character's personality was the most important indicator of appeal. We used a number of perceptual metrics such as subjective ratings, proximity, and attribution bias in order to test our hypothesis. Our main result shows that affinity towards virtual characters is a complex interaction between the character's appearance and personality, and that realism is in fact a positive choice for virtual characters in virtual reality.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2794638","Keywords":"Personality;virtual characters;virtual reality;perception"},"126":{"Title":"A Framework for Externalizing Implicit Error Using Visualization","Authors":"N.

Grounded in an 18-month design study with global health experts, the framework formalizes the notion of data discrepancies as implicit error, both in global health data and more broadly. We use the term implicit error to describe measurement error that is inherent to and pervasive throughout a dataset, but that isn't explicitly accounted for or defined. Instead, implicit error exists in the minds of experts, is mainly qualitative, and is accounted for subjectively during expert interpretation of the data. Externalizing knowledge surrounding implicit error can assist in synchronizing, validating, and enhancing interpretation, and can inform error analysis and mitigation. The framework consists of a description of implicit error components that are important for downstream analysis, along with a process model for externalizing and analyzing implicit error using visualization. As a second contribution, we provide a rich, reflective, and verifiable description of our research process as an exemplar summary toward the ongoing inquiry into ways of increasing the validity and transferability of design study research.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864913","Keywords":"implicit error;knowledge externalization;design study"},"127":{"Title":"Visualization and Analysis of Rotating Stall for Transonic Jet Engine Simulation","Authors":"C.

With recent advancements of high performance computing, high-resolution unsteady flow fields allow in depth exploration of rotating stall and its possible causes. Performing stall analysis, however, involves significant effort to process large amounts of simulation data, especially when investigating abnormalities across many time steps. In order to assist scientists during the exploration process, we present a visual analytics framework to identify suspected spatiotemporal regions through a comparative visualization so that scientists are able to focus on relevant data in more detail. To achieve this, we propose efficient stall analysis algorithms derived from domain knowledge and convey the analysis results through juxtaposed interactive plots.

Hao; C. G. Healey; S. A. Bass","Abstract":"An ensemble is a collection of related datasets, called members, built from a series of runs of a simulation or an experiment. Ensembles are large, temporal, multidimensional, and multivariate, making them difficult to analyze. Another important challenge is visualizing ensembles that vary both in space and time. Initial visualization techniques displayed ensembles with a small number of members, or presented an overview of an entire ensemble, but without potentially important details. Recently, researchers have suggested combining these two directions, allowing users to choose subsets of members to visualization. This manual selection process places the burden on the user to identify which members to explore. We first introduce a static ensemble visualization system that automatically helps users locate interesting subsets of members to visualize. We next extend the system to support analysis and visualization of temporal ensembles. We employ 3D shape comparison, cluster tree visualization, and glyph based visualization to represent different levels of detail within an ensemble. This strategy is used to provide two approaches for temporal ensemble analysis: (1) segment based ensemble analysis, to capture important shape transition time-steps, clusters groups of similar members, and identify common shape changes over time across multiple members; and (2) time-step based ensemble analysis, which assumes ensemble members are aligned in time by combining similar shapes at common time-steps. Both approaches enable users to interactively visualize and analyze a temporal ensemble from different perspectives at different levels of detail. We demonstrate our techniques on an ensemble studying matter transition from hadronic gas to quark-gluon plasma during gold-on-gold particle collisions.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2468093","Keywords":"Ensemble visualization;Ensemble visualization"},"129":{"Title":"Screen-Space Normal Distribution Function Caching for Consistent Multi-Resolution Rendering of Large Particle Data","Authors":"M. Ibrahim; P. Wickenh\u00e4user; P. Rautek; G. Reina; M. Hadwiger","Abstract":"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are crucial to investigating important processes in physics and thermodynamics. The simulated atoms are usually visualized as hard spheres with Phong shading, where individual particles and their local density can be perceived well in close-up views. However, for large-scale simulations with 10 million particles or more, the visualization of large fields-of-view usually suffers from strong aliasing artifacts, because the mismatch between data size and output resolution leads to severe under-sampling of the geometry. Excessive super-sampling can alleviate this problem, but is prohibitively expensive. This paper presents a novel visualization method for large-scale particle data that addresses aliasing while enabling interactive high-quality rendering. We introduce the novel concept of screen-space normal distribution functions (S-NDFs) for particle data. S-NDFs represent the distribution of surface normals that map to a given pixel in screen space, which enables high-quality re-lighting without re-rendering particles. In order to facilitate interactive zooming, we cache S-NDFs in a screen-space mipmap (S-MIP). Together, these two concepts enable interactive, scale-consistent re-lighting and shading changes, as well as zooming, without having to re-sample the particle data. We show how our method facilitates the interactive exploration of real-world large-scale MD simulation data in different scenarios.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2743979","Keywords":"Multiresolution Techniques;Point-Based Data;Glyph-based Techniques;Scalability Issues;Molecular Visualization"},"130":{"Title":"Visualizing Dataflow Graphs of Deep Learning Models in TensorFlow","Authors":"K.

We achieve this by learning from photographs of world famous landmarks that are available on the Internet and their viewpoint quality ranked by online user annotation. Unlike previous efforts devoted to photo quality assessment which mainly rely on 2D image features, we show in this paper combining 2D image features extracted from images with 3D geometric features computed on the 3D models can result in more reliable evaluation of viewpoint quality. Specifically, we collect a set of photographs for each of 15 world famous architectures as well as their 3D models from the Internet. Viewpoint recovery for images is carried out through an image-model registration process, after which a newly proposed viewpoint clustering strategy is exploited to validate users' viewpoint preferences when photographing landmarks. Finally, we extract a number of 2D and 3D features for each image based on multiple visual and geometric cues and perform viewpoint recommendation by learning from both 2D and 3D features using a specifically designed SVM-2K multi-view learner, achieving superior performance over using solely 2D or 3D features. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments. The experiments also demonstrate that our system can be used to recommend viewpoints for rendering textured 3D models of buildings for the use of architectural design, in addition to viewpoint evaluation of photographs and recommendation of viewpoints for photographing architectures in practice.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2853751","Keywords":"Viewpoint assessment;viewpoint recommendation;learning;image aesthetics"},"132":{"Title":"ConceptVector: Text Visual Analytics via Interactive Lexicon Building Using Word Embedding","Authors":"D.

We use several simple monocular cues to estimate disparity maps and confidence maps of low spatial and temporal resolution in real-time. These are complemented by spatially-varying, appearance-dependent and class-specific disparity prior maps, learned from example stereo images. Scene classification selects this prior at runtime.

Yet, despite the acknowledged potential benefits of catching up with these theories a gap remains. This paper first aims to contribute to fill this gap by introducing a theory according to which the SoA can be divided into two components, the feeling and the judgment of agency, and relies on three principles, namely the principles of priority, exclusivity and consistency. We argue that this theory could provide insights on the factors influencing the SoA in VR systems. Second, we propose novel approaches to manipulate the SoA in controlled VR experiments (based on these three principles) as well as to measure the SoA, and more specifically its two components based on neurophysiological markers, using ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG). We claim that these approaches would enable us to deepen our understanding of the SoA in VR contexts. Finally, we validate these approaches in an experiment. Our results (N=24) suggest that our approach was successful in manipulating the SoA as the modulation of each of the three principles induced significant decreases of the SoA (measured using questionnaires). In addition, we recorded participants' EEG signals during the VR experiment, and neurophysiological markers of the SoA, potentially reflecting the feeling and judgment of agency specifically, were revealed. Our results also suggest that users' profile, more precisely their Locus of Control (LoC), influences their level of immersion and SoA.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2794598","Keywords":"Sense of Agency;Priority Principle;Consistency Principle;Exclusivity Principle;Feeling of Agency;Judgment of Agency;EEG;Neurophysiological Marker;Pre-Motor Cortex;Right Posterior Parietal Cortex;Locus of Control"},"135":{"Title":"Evaluating \u2018Graphical Perception\u2019 with CNNs","Authors":"D.

In contrast to existing work, our trimming method scales well with a large number of trim curves and estimates the trimmed surface's footprint in screen-space which allows for an anti-aliasing with minimal performance overhead. Fragments with trimmed edges are routed into a designated off-screen buffer for subsequent blending with background faces. The evaluation of the presented algorithms shows that our rendering system can handle CAD models with ten thousands of trimmed NURBS surfaces.

In visual analysis systems, projections embed multidimensional data into 2D or 3D spaces for graphical representation. To facilitate a robust and accurate analysis, essential characteristics of the multidimensional data shall be preserved when projecting. Orthographic star coordinates is a state-of-the-art linear projection method that avoids distortion of multidimensional clusters by restricting interactive exploration to orthographic projections. However, existing numerical methods for computing orthographic star coordinates have a number of limitations when putting them into practice. We overcome these limitations by proposing the novel concept of shape-preserving star coordinates where shape preservation is assured using a superset of orthographic projections. Our scheme is explicit, exact, simple, fast, parameter-free, and stable. To maintain a valid shape-preserving star-coordinates configuration during user interaction with one of the star-coordinates axes, we derive an algorithm that only requires us to modify the configuration of one additional compensatory axis. Different design goals can be targeted by using different strategies for selecting the compensatory axis. We propose and discuss four strategies including a strategy that approximates orthographic star coordinates very well and a data-driven strategy. We further present shape-preserving morphing strategies between two shape-preserving configurations, which can be adapted for the generation of data tours.

We discuss the integration of these contributions into a functional prototype tool, and also reflect on the many practical challenges that arise when working with weather data.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467754","Keywords":"Design study;weather;geographic\/geospatial visualization;ensemble data;Design study;weather;geographic\/geospatial visualization;ensemble data"},"145":{"Title":"Classification of Blood Flow Patterns in Cerebral Aneurysms","Authors":"M. Meuschke; S. Oeltze-Jafra; O. Beuing; B. Preim; K. Lawonn","Abstract":"We present a Cerebral Aneurysm Vortex Classification (CAVOCLA) that allows to classify blood flow in cerebral aneurysms. Medical studies assume a strong relation between the progression and rupture of aneurysms and flow patterns. To understand how flow patterns impact the vessel morphology, they are manually classified according to predefined classes. However, manual classifications are time-consuming and exhibit a high inter-observer variability. In contrast, our approach is more objective and faster than manual methods. The classification of integral lines, representing steady or unsteady blood flow, is based on a mapping of the aneurysm surface to a hemisphere by calculating polar-based coordinates. The lines are clustered and for each cluster a representative is calculated. Then, the polar-based coordinates are transformed to the representative as basis for the classification. Classes are based on the flow complexity. The classification results are presented by a detail-on-demand approach using a visual transition from the representative over an enclosing surface to the associated lines. Based on seven representative datasets, we conduct an informal interview with five domain experts to evaluate the system. They confirmed that CAVOCLA allows for a robust classification of intra-aneurysmal flow patterns. The detail-on-demand visualization enables an efficient exploration and interpretation of flow patterns.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2834923","Keywords":"Medical visualizations;aneurysms;blood flow;parametrization;classification"},"146":{"Title":"Multi-Character Physical and Behavioral Interactions Controller","Authors":"J.

We take a systematic approach integrating all the equations of motions of the characters, objects, and articulated environment parts in a single QP formulation in order to embrace and solve the most general instance of the problem, where independent individual character controllers would fail to account for the inherent coupling of their respective motions through those physical and behavioral interactions.

Set-typed attributes describe rich relations across elements, sets, and the set intersections. Increasing the number of sets results in a combinatorial growth of relations and creates scalability challenges. Exploratory tasks (e.g. selection, comparison) have commonly been designed in separation for set-typed attributes, which reduces interface consistency. To improve on scalability and to support rich, contextual exploration of set-typed data, we present AggreSet. AggreSet creates aggregations for each data dimension: sets, set-degrees, set-pair intersections, and other attributes. It visualizes the element count per aggregate using a matrix plot for set-pair intersections, and histograms for set lists, set-degrees and other attributes. Its non-overlapping visual design is scalable to numerous and large sets. AggreSet supports selection, filtering, and comparison as core exploratory tasks. It allows analysis of set relations inluding subsets, disjoint sets and set intersection strength, and also features perceptual set ordering for detecting patterns in set matrices. Its interaction is designed for rich and rapid data exploration. We demonstrate results on a wide range of datasets from different domains with varying characteristics, and report on expert reviews and a case study using student enrollment and degree data with assistant deans at a major public university.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467051","Keywords":"Multi-valued attributes;sets;visualization;set visualization;data exploration;interaction;design;scalability;Multi-valued attributes;sets;visualization;set visualization;data exploration;interaction;design;scalability"},"148":{"Title":"Instant Construction and Visualization of Crowded Biological Environments","Authors":"T.

Soluble molecules are populated within compartments distributed according to a Halton sequence. Fibrous structures, such as RNA or actin filaments, are created by self-avoiding random walks. Resulting overlaps of molecules are resolved by a forced-based system. Our approach opens new possibilities to the world of interactive construction of cellular compartments.

Holden; J. Saito; T. Komura","Abstract":"We present a framework to design inverse rig-functions-functions that map low level representations of a character's pose such as joint positions or surface geometry to the representation used by animators called the animation rig. Animators design scenes using an animation rig, a framework widely adopted in animation production which allows animators to design character poses and geometry via intuitive parameters and interfaces. Yet most state-of-the-art computer animation techniques control characters through raw, low level representations such as joint angles, joint positions, or vertex coordinates. This difference often stops the adoption of state-of-the-art techniques in animation production. Our framework solves this issue by learning a mapping between the low level representations of the pose and the animation rig. We use nonlinear regression techniques, learning from example animation sequences designed by the animators. When new motions are provided in the skeleton space, the learned mapping is used to estimate the rig controls that reproduce such a motion. We introduce two nonlinear functions for producing such a mapping: Gaussian process regression and feedforward neural networks. The appropriate solution depends on the nature of the rig and the amount of data available for training. We show our framework applied to various examples including articulated biped characters, quadruped characters, facial animation rigs, and deformable characters. With our system, animators have the freedom to apply any motion synthesis algorithm to arbitrary rigging and animation pipelines for immediate editing. This greatly improves the productivity of 3D animation, while retaining the flexibility and creativity of artistic input.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2628036","Keywords":"Animation rig;character animation;regression"},"151":{"Title":"Podium: Ranking Data Using Mixed-Initiative Visual Analytics","Authors":"E. Wall; S. Das; R. Chawla; B. Kalidindi; E. T. Brown; A. Endert","Abstract":"People often rank and order data points as a vital part of making decisions. Multi-attribute ranking systems are a common tool used to make these data-driven decisions. Such systems often take the form of a table-based visualization in which users assign weights to the attributes representing the quantifiable importance of each attribute to a decision, which the system then uses to compute a ranking of the data. However, these systems assume that users are able to quantify their conceptual understanding of how important particular attributes are to a decision. This is not always easy or even possible for users to do. Rather, people often have a more holistic understanding of the data. They form opinions that data point A is better than data point B but do not necessarily know which attributes are important. To address these challenges, we present a visual analytic application to help people rank multi-variate data points. We developed a prototype system, Podium, that allows users to drag rows in the table to rank order data points based on their perception of the relative value of the data. Podium then infers a weighting model using Ranking SVM that satisfies the user's data preferences as closely as possible. Whereas past systems help users understand the relationships between data points based on changes to attribute weights, our approach helps users to understand the attributes that might inform their understanding of the data. We present two usage scenarios to describe some of the potential uses of our proposed technique: (1) understanding which attributes contribute to a user's subjective preferences for data, and (2) deconstructing attributes of importance for existing rankings. Our proposed approach makes powerful machine learning techniques more usable to those who may not have expertise in these areas.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2745078","Keywords":"Mixed-initiative visual analytics;multi-attribute ranking;user interaction"},"152":{"Title":"Robust and Fast Extraction of 3D Symmetric Tensor Field Topology","Authors":"L.

MacQuarrie; A. Steed","Abstract":"360\u00b0 images and video have become extremely popular formats for immersive displays, due in large part to the technical ease of content production. While many experiences use a single camera viewpoint, an increasing number of experiences use multiple camera locations. In such multi-view 360\u00b0 media (MV360M) systems, a visual effect is required when the user transitions from one camera location to another. This effect can take several forms, such as a cut or an image-based warp, and the choice of effect may impact many aspects of the experience, including issues related to enjoyment and scene understanding. To investigate the effect of transition types on immersive MV360M experiences, a repeated-measures experiment was conducted with 31 participants. Wearing a head-mounted display, participants explored four static scenes, for which multiple 360\u00b0 images and a reconstructed 3D model were available. Three transition types were examined: teleport, a linear move through a 3D model of the scene, and an image-based transition using a M\u00f6bius transformation. The metrics investigated included spatial awareness, users' movement profiles, transition preference and the subjective feeling of moving through the space. Results indicate that there was no significant difference between transition types in terms of spatial awareness, while significant differences were found for users' movement profiles, with participants taking 1.6 seconds longer to select their next location following a teleport transition. The model and M\u00f6bius transitions were significantly better in terms of creating the feeling of moving through the space. Preference was also significantly different, with model and teleport transitions being preferred over M\u00f6bius transitions. Our results indicate that trade-offs between transitions will require content creators to think carefully about what aspects they consider to be most important when producing MV360M experiences.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2793561","Keywords":"H.5.1 [Information interfaces and presentation]: Multimedia Information Systems \u2014 Artificial, augmented and virtual realities"},"155":{"Title":"Objective Vortex Corelines of Finite-sized Objects in Fluid Flows","Authors":"T. G\u00fcnther; H. Theisel","Abstract":"Vortices are one of the most-frequently studied phenomena in fluid flows. The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864828","Keywords":"Vortex extraction;inertial particles;objectivity;vortex coreline"},"156":{"Title":"FiberClay: Sculpting Three Dimensional Trajectories to Reveal Structural Insights","Authors":"C.

Air traffic controllers for example deal with large quantities of aircrafts routes to optimize safety in airspace and neuroscientists attempt to understand neuronal pathways in the human brain by visualizing bundles of fibers from DTI images. Extracting insights from masses of 3D trajectories is challenging as the multiple three dimensional lines have complex geometries, may overlap, cross or even merge with each other, making it impossible to follow individual ones in dense areas. As trajectories are inherently spatial and three dimensional, we propose FiberClay: a system to display and interact with 3D trajectories in immersive environments. FiberClay renders a large quantity of trajectories in real time using GP-GPU techniques. FiberClay also introduces a new set of interactive techniques for composing complex queries in 3D space leveraging immersive environment controllers and user position. These techniques enable an analyst to select and compare sets of trajectories with specific geometries and data properties. We conclude by discussing insights found using FiberClay with domain experts in air traffic control and neurology.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865191","Keywords":"Immersive Analytics;3D Visualization;Dynamic Queries;Bimanual Interaction;Multidimensional Data"},"157":{"Title":"User-Perspective AR Magic Lens from Gradient-Based IBR and Semi-Dense Stereo","Authors":"D.

However, we lack guidance on how to effectively visualize ranges on small displays in the context of different value retrieval and comparison tasks, or with respect to different data characteristics such as periodicity, seasonality, or the cardinality of ranges. Central to our experiment is a comparison between two ways to lay out ranges: a more conventional linear layout strikes a balance between quantitative and chronological scale resolution, while a less conventional radial layout emphasizes the cyclicality of time and may prioritize discrimination between values at its periphery. With results from 87 crowd workers, we found that while participants completed tasks more quickly with linear layouts than with radial ones, there were few differences in terms of error rate between layout conditions. We also found that participants performed similarly with both layouts in tasks that involved comparing superimposed observed and average ranges.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865234","Keywords":"Evaluation;graphical perception;mobile phones;range visualization;crowdsourcing"},"159":{"Title":"CyteGuide: Visual Guidance for Hierarchical Single-Cell Analysis","Authors":"T.

We also develop a feature preserving normal estimation method which outputs multiple normals per feature point. The core of the method is a pair consistency voting scheme. All neighbor point pairs vote for the local tangent plane. Each vote takes the fitting residuals of the pair of points and their preliminary normal consistency into consideration. Thus the pairs from the same subspace and relatively far off features dominate the voting. An adaptive strategy is designed to overcome sampling anisotropy. In addition, we introduce an error measure compatible with traditional normal estimators, and present the first benchmark for normal estimation, composed of 152 synthesized data with various features and sampling densities, and 288 real scans with different noise levels.

For tensor fields, however, effective, interactive visualizations are still missing despite progress over the last decades. We present a general approach for the generation of separating surfaces in symmetric, second-order, three-dimensional tensor fields. These surfaces are defined as fiber surfaces of the invariant space, i.e. as pre-images of surfaces in the range of a complete set of invariants. This approach leads to a generalization of the fiber surface algorithm by Klacansky et al. [16] to three dimensions in the range. This is due to the fact that the invariant space is three-dimensional for symmetric second-order tensors over a spatial domain. We present an algorithm for surface construction for simplicial grids in the domain and simplicial surfaces in the invariant space.

Burlinson; K. Subramanian; P. Goolkasian","Abstract":"Effective communication using visualization relies in part on the use of viable encoding strategies. For example, a viewer's ability to rapidly and accurately discern between two or more categorical variables in a chart or figure is contingent upon the distinctiveness of the encodings applied to each variable. Research in perception suggests that color is a more salient visual feature when compared to shape and although that finding is supported by visualization studies, characteristics of shape also yield meaningful differences in distinctiveness. We propose that open or closed shapes (that is, whether shapes are composed of line segments that are bounded across a region of space or not) represent a salient characteristic that influences perceptual processing. Three experiments were performed to test the reliability of the open\/closed category; the first two from the perspective of attentional allocation, and the third experiment in the context of multi-class scatterplot displays. In the first, a flanker paradigm was used to test whether perceptual load and open\/closed feature category would modulate the effect of the flanker on target processing. Results showed an influence of both variables. The second experiment used a Same\/Different reaction time task to replicate and extend those findings. Results from both show that responses are faster and more accurate when closed rather than open shapes are processed as targets, and there is more processing interference when two competing shapes come from the same rather than different open or closed feature categories. The third experiment employed three commonly used visual analytic tasks - perception of average value, numerosity, and linear relationships with both single and dual displays of open and closed symbols. Our findings show that for numerosity and trend judgments, in particular, that different symbols from the same open or closed feature category cause more perceptual interference when they are presented together in a plot than symbols from different categories. Moreover, the extent of the interference appears to depend upon whether the participant is focused on processing open or closed symbols.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2745086","Keywords":"scatterplot;visualization design;perceptual category;open shape;closed shape"},"170":{"Title":"Timelines Revisited: A Design Space and Considerations for Expressive Storytelling","Authors":"M.

In a storytelling context where the intent is to convey multiple narrative points, a richer set of timeline designs may be more appropriate than the narrow range that has been used for exploratory data analysis by the research community. Informed by a survey of 263 timelines, we present a design space for storytelling with timelines that balances expressiveness and effectiveness, identifying 14 design choices characterized by three dimensions: representation, scale, and layout. Twenty combinations of these choices are viable timeline designs that can be matched to different narrative points, while smooth animated transitions between narrative points allow for the presentation of a cohesive story, an important aspect of both interactive storytelling and data videos. We further validate this design space by realizing the full set of viable timeline designs and transitions in a proof-of-concept sandbox implementation that we used to produce seven example timeline stories. Ultimately, this work is intended to inform and inspire the design of future tools for storytelling with timelines.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2614803","Keywords":"Timelines;storytelling;narrative visualization;design space;animated transitions"},"171":{"Title":"Volumetric Feature-Based Classification and Visibility Analysis for Transfer Function Design","Authors":"B.

The presented approach provides an interactive tool that aids users in exploring clusters and identifying features of interest (FOI). Second, our method automatically generates a TF by iteratively refining the optical properties for the selected features using a novel feature visibility measurement. The proposed visibility measurement leverages the similarities of features to enhance their visibilities in DVR images. Compared to the conventional visibility measurement, the proposed feature visibility is able to efficiently sense opacity changes and precisely evaluate the impact of selected features on resulting visualizations.

It is nonetheless essential in several applications such as retexturing. A recent geometric model called JOLIMAS partially answers this problem, under the assumptions that the specularities are elliptical and the scene is planar. JOLIMAS models a moving specularity as the image of a fixed 3D quadric. We propose dual JOLIMAS, a new model which raises the planarity assumption. It uses the fact that specularities remain elliptical on convex surfaces and that every surface can be divided in convex parts. The geometry of dual JOLIMAS then uses a 3D quadric per convex surface part and light source, and predicts the specularities by a means of virtual cameras, allowing it to cope with surface's unflatness. We assessed the efficiency and precision of dual JOLIMAS on multiple synthetic and real videos with various objects and lighting conditions. We give results of a retexturing application.

Drawing on research on autobiographical memory and on the role of artifacts in reminiscing, we identified design challenges for visual mementos: mapping data to evoke familiarity, expressing subjectivity, and obscuring sensitive details for sharing. Visual mementos can make use of the known strengths of visualization in revealing patterns to show the familiar instead of the unexpected, and extend representational mappings beyond the objective to include the more subjective. To understand whether people's subjective views on their past can be reflected in a visual representation, we developed, deployed and studied a technology probe that exemplifies our concept of visual mementos.

A possible alternative is to use a reduced model, involving only the temporal evolution of the mass density of the film on the surface. However, in this model, the motion is governed by a fourth-order nonlinear PDE, which involves geometric quantities such as the curvature of the underlying surface, and is therefore difficult to discretize. Inspired by a recent variational formulation for this problem on smooth surfaces, we present a corresponding model for triangle meshes. We provide a discretization for the curvature and advection operators which leads to an efficient and stable numerical scheme, requires a single sparse linear solve per time step, and exactly preserves the total volume of the fluid. We validate our method by qualitatively comparing to known results from the literature, and demonstrate various intricate effects achievable by our method, such as droplet formation, evaporation, droplets interaction and viscous fingering. Finally, we extend our method to incorporate non-linear van der Waals forcing terms which stabilize the motion of the film and allow additional effects such as pearling.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2605083","Keywords":"Computer graphics;three-dimensional graphics and realism;animation"},"181":{"Title":"Real-Time Collision Detection for Deformable Characters with Radial Fields","Authors":"S.

Users must be able to find content quickly, labels and indicators must not be invasive but still clearly noticeable, and the user interface should maximize search performance in a variety of conditions. To address these issues, we have set up a series of experiments to test the influence of virtual characteristics such as color, size, and leader lines on the performance of search tasks and noticeability in both real and simulated environments. We evaluate two primary areas, including 1) the effects of peripheral field of view (FOV) limitations and labeling techniques on target acquisition during outdoor mobile search, and 2) the influence of local characteristics such as color, size, and motion on text labels over dynamic backgrounds. The first experiment showed that limited FOV will severely limit search performance, but that appropriate placement of labels and leaders within the periphery can alleviate this problem without interfering with walking or decreasing user comfort. In the second experiment, we found that different types of motion are more noticeable in optical versus video see-through displays, but that blue coloration is most noticeable in both.

The computation of cloth mechanics at the yarn level appears as a computationally complex and costly process at first sight, due to the need to resolve many fine-scale contact interactions. We propose instead an efficient representation of cloth at the yarn level that treats yarn-yarn contacts as persistent, but with the possibility to slide, thereby avoiding expensive contact handling altogether. We introduce a compact representation of yarn geometry and kinematics, capturing the essential deformation modes of yarn crossings, loops, stitches, and stacks, with a minimum cost. Based on this representation, we design force models that reproduce the characteristic macroscopic behavior of yarn-based fabrics. Our approach is suited for both woven and knitted fabrics.

In geometrically complex situations where many surfaces intersect a pixel, current rendering systems shade each contributing surface at least once per pixel. As the sample density and geometric complexity increase, the shading cost becomes prohibitive for real-time rendering. Under deferred shading, so does the required framebuffer memory. Our goal is to make high per-pixel sampling rates practical for real-time applications by substantially reducing shading costs and per-pixel storage compared to traditional deferred shading. AGAA uses the rasterization pipeline to generate a compact, pre-filtered geometric representation inside each pixel. We shade this representation at a fixed rate, independent of geometric complexity. By decoupling shading rate from geometric sampling rate, the algorithm reduces the storage and bandwidth costs of a geometry buffer, and allows scaling to high visibility sampling rates for anti-aliasing.

In this paper, we present an effective approach for color assignment based on a set of given colors that is designed to optimize the perception of scatterplots. Our approach takes into account the spatial relationships, density, degree of overlap between point clusters, and also the background color. For this purpose, we use a genetic algorithm that is able to efficiently find good color assignments. We implemented an interactive color assignment system with three extensions of the basic method that incorporates top K suggestions, user-defined color subsets, and classes of interest for the optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our assignment technique, we conducted a numerical study and a controlled user study to compare our approach with default color assignments; our findings were verified by two expert studies. The results show that our approach is able to support users in distinguishing cluster numbers faster and more precisely than default assignment methods.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864912","Keywords":"Color perception;visual design;scatterplots"},"194":{"Title":"SRVis: Towards Better Spatial Integration in Ranking Visualization","Authors":"D. Weng; R. Chen; Z. Deng; F. Wu; J. Chen; Y. Wu","Abstract":"Interactive ranking techniques have substantially promoted analysts' ability in making judicious and informed decisions effectively based on multiple criteria. However, the existing techniques cannot satisfactorily support the analysis tasks involved in ranking large-scale spatial alternatives, such as selecting optimal locations for chain stores, where the complex spatial contexts involved are essential to the decision-making process. Limitations observed in the prior attempts of integrating rankings with spatial contexts motivate us to develop a context-integrated visual ranking technique. Based on a set of generic design requirements we summarized by collaborating with domain experts, we propose SRVis, a novel spatial ranking visualization technique that supports efficient spatial multi-criteria decision-making processes by addressing three major challenges in the aforementioned context integration, namely, a) the presentation of spatial rankings and contexts, b) the scalability of rankings' visual representations, and c) the analysis of context-integrated spatial rankings. Specifically, we encode massive rankings and their cause with scalable matrix-based visualizations and stacked bar charts based on a novel two-phase optimization framework that minimizes the information loss, and the flexible spatial filtering and intuitive comparative analysis are adopted to enable the in-depth evaluation of the rankings and assist users in selecting the best spatial alternative. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been evaluated and demonstrated with an empirical study of optimization methods, two case studies, and expert interviews.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865126","Keywords":"Spatial ranking;visualization"},"195":{"Title":"Immersive Virtual Colonoscopy","Authors":"S.

We present an immersive analytics system for VC which enhances and improves the traditional desktop VC through the use of VR technologies. Our system, using a head-mounted display (HMD), includes all of the standard VC features, such as the volume rendered endoluminal fly-through, measurement tool, bookmark modes, electronic biopsy, and slice views. The use of VR immersion, stereo, and wider field of view and field of regard has a positive effect on polyp search and analysis tasks in our immersive VC system, a volumetric-based immersive analytics application. Navigation includes enhanced automatic speed and direction controls, based on the user's head orientation, in conjunction with physical navigation for exploration of local proximity. In order to accommodate the resolution and frame rate requirements for HMDs, new rendering techniques have been developed, including mesh-assisted volume raycasting and a novel lighting paradigm. Feedback and further suggestions from expert radiologists show the promise of our system for immersive analysis for VC and encourage new avenues for exploring the use of VR in visualization systems for medical diagnosis.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2019.2898763","Keywords":"Immersive Environments;Immersive Analytics;Interaction Design;Volume Rendering;Biomedical Visualization;Colon Cancer Screening;Medical Diagnosis"},"196":{"Title":"Temporal Resolution Multiplexing: Exploiting the limitations of spatio-temporal vision for more efficient VR rendering","Authors":"G. Denes; K. Maruszczyk; G. Ash; R. K. Mantiuk","Abstract":"Rendering in virtual reality (VR) requires substantial computational power to generate 90 frames per second at high resolution with good-quality antialiasing. The video data sent to a VR headset requires high bandwidth, achievable only on dedicated links. In this paper we explain how rendering requirements and transmission bandwidth can be reduced using a conceptually simple technique that integrates well with existing rendering pipelines. Every even-numbered frame is rendered at a lower resolution, and every odd-numbered frame is kept at high resolution but is modified in order to compensate for the previous loss of high spatial frequencies. When the frames are seen at a high frame rate, they are fused and perceived as high-resolution and high-frame-rate animation. The technique relies on the limited ability of the visual system to perceive high spatio-temporal frequencies. Despite its conceptual simplicity, correct execution of the technique requires a number of non-trivial steps: display photometric temporal response must be modeled, flicker and motion artifacts must be avoided, and the generated signal must not exceed the dynamic range of the display. Our experiments, performed on a high-frame-rate LCD monitor and OLED-based VR headsets, explore the parameter space of the proposed technique and demonstrate that its perceived quality is indistinguishable from full-resolution rendering. The technique is an attractive alternative to reprojection and resolution reduction of all frames.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2019.2898741","Keywords":"Temporal multiplexing;rendering;graphics;perception;virtual reality"},"197":{"Title":"Real-Time 3D Eye Performance Reconstruction for RGBD Cameras","Authors":"Q.

Subduction of one plate causes large-scale asymmetry while their layered composition (or stratigraphy) explains the multi-scale folded strata observed on real terrains. We introduce a novel interactive modeling technique to generate visually plausible, large scale terrains that capture these phenomena. Our method draws on both geological knowledge for consistency and on sculpting systems for user interaction. The user is provided hands-on control on the shape and motion of tectonic plates, represented using a new geologically-inspired model for the Earth crust. The model captures their volume preserving and complex folding behaviors under collision, causing mountains to grow. It generates a volumetric uplift map representing the growth rate of subsurface layers. Erosion and uplift movement are jointly simulated to generate the terrain. The stratigraphy allows us to render folded strata on eroded cliffs. We validated the usability of our sculpting interface through a user study, and compare the visual consistency of the earth crust model with geological simulation results and real terrains.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2689022","Keywords":"Terrains;mountains;interactive design;geology"},"200":{"Title":"Bridging from Goals to Tasks with Design Study Analysis Reports","Authors":"H. Lam; M. Tory; T. Munzner","Abstract":"Visualization researchers and practitioners engaged in generating or evaluating designs are faced with the difficult problem of transforming the questions asked and actions taken by target users from domain-specific language and context into more abstract forms. Existing abstract task classifications aim to provide support for this endeavour by providing a carefully delineated suite of actions. Our experience is that this bottom-up approach is part of the challenge: low-level actions are difficult to interpret without a higher-level context of analysis goals and the analysis process. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework based on analysis reports derived from open-coding 20 design study papers published at IEEE InfoVis 2009-2015, to build on the previous work of abstractions that collectively encompass a broad variety of domains. The framework is organized in two axes illustrated by nine analysis goals. It helps situate the analysis goals by placing each goal under axes of specificity (Explore, Describe, Explain, Confirm) and number of data populations (Single, Multiple). The single-population types are Discover Observation, Describe Observation, Identify Main Cause, and Collect Evidence. The multiple-population types are Compare Entities, Explain Differences, and Evaluate Hypothesis. Each analysis goal is scoped by an input and an output and is characterized by analysis steps reported in the design study papers. We provide examples of how we and others have used the framework in a top-down approach to abstracting domain problems: visualization designers or researchers first identify the analysis goals of each unit of analysis in an analysis stream, and then encode the individual steps using existing task classifications with the context of the goal, the level of specificity, and the number of populations involved in the analysis.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744319","Keywords":"Framework;Data Analysis;Analysis Goals;Design Studies;Open Coding;Task Classifications"},"201":{"Title":"Accurate Interactive Visualization of Large Deformations and Variability in Biomedical Image Ensembles","Authors":"M. Hermann; A. C. Schunke; T. Schultz; R. Klein","Abstract":"Large image deformations pose a challenging problem for the visualization and statistical analysis of 3D image ensembles which have a multitude of applications in biology and medicine. Simple linear interpolation in the tangent space of the ensemble introduces artifactual anatomical structures that hamper the application of targeted visual shape analysis techniques. In this work we make use of the theory of stationary velocity fields to facilitate interactive non-linear image interpolation and plausible extrapolation for high quality rendering of large deformations and devise an efficient image warping method on the GPU. This does not only improve quality of existing visualization techniques, but opens up a field of novel interactive methods for shape ensemble analysis. Taking advantage of the efficient non-linear 3D image warping, we showcase four visualizations: 1) browsing on-the-fly computed group mean shapes to learn about shape differences between specific classes, 2) interactive reformation to investigate complex morphologies in a single view, 3) likelihood volumes to gain a concise overview of variability and 4) streamline visualization to show variation in detail, specifically uncovering its component tangential to a reference surface. Evaluation on a real world dataset shows that the presented method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of visual quality while retaining interactive frame rates. A case study with a domain expert was performed in which the novel analysis and visualization methods are applied on standard model structures, namely skull and mandible of different rodents, to investigate and compare influence of phylogeny, diet and geography on shape. The visualizations enable for instance to distinguish (population-)normal and pathological morphology, assist in uncovering correlation to extrinsic factors and potentially support assessment of model quality.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467198","Keywords":"Statistical deformation model;stationary velocity fields;image warping,;interactive visual analysiimage warping,;Statistical deformation model;stationary velocity fields;image warping;interactive visual analysis"},"202":{"Title":"Intuitive Exploration of Volumetric Data Using Dynamic Galleries","Authors":"D.

Interacting in the data domain is an effective way to filter away undesired information but it is difficult to predict where the values lie in the spatial domain. In this work we make extensive use of dynamic previews instantly generated as the user explores the data domain. The previews allow the user to predict what effect changes in the data domain will have on the rendered image without being aware that visual parameters are set in the data domain. Each preview represents a subrange of the data domain where overview and details are given on demand through zooming and panning.

We present a multi-stage Visual Analytics (VA) approach for iterative cluster refinement together with an implementation (SOMFlow) that uses Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to analyze time series data. It supports exploration by offering the analyst a visual platform to analyze intermediate results, adapt the underlying computations, iteratively partition the data, and to reflect previous analytical activities. The history of previous decisions is explicitly visualized within a flow graph, allowing to compare earlier cluster refinements and to explore relations. We further leverage quality and interestingness measures to guide the analyst in the discovery of useful patterns, relations, and data partitions.

Here, we propose a technique based on a fast physically-inspired approach, that focuses on modeling the changes in appearance due to pollution soiling on an urban scale. We consider pollution effects to depend on three main factors: wind, rain and sun exposure, and we take into account three intervening steps: deposition, reaction and washing. Using a low-cost pre-computation, we evaluate the pollution distribution throughout the city. Based on this and the use of screen-space operators, our method results in an efficient approach able to generate realistic images of urban scenes by combining the intervening factors at interactive rates. In addition, the pre-computation demands a reduced amount of memory to store the resulting pollution map and, as it is independent from scene complexity, it can suit large and complex models by adapting the map resolution.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2794526","Keywords":"Weathering;appearance;interactive rendering;urban scenes;screen-space techniques;shading and texture;picture\/image generation"},"207":{"Title":"Hypothetical Outcome Plots Help Untrained Observers Judge Trends in Ambiguous Data","Authors":"A.

HOPs greatly improve multivariate probability estimation over conventional static uncertainty visualizations and leverage the ability of the visual system to quickly, accurately, and automatically process the summary statistical properties of ensembles. However, it is unclear how well HOPs support applied tasks resembling real world judgments posed in uncertainty communication. We identify and motivate an appropriate task to investigate realistic judgments of uncertainty in the public domain through a qualitative analysis of uncertainty visualizations in the news. We contribute two crowdsourced experiments comparing the effectiveness of HOPs, error bars, and line ensembles for supporting perceptual decision-making from visualized uncertainty. Participants infer which of two possible underlying trends is more likely to have produced a sample of time series data by referencing uncertainty visualizations which depict the two trends with variability due to sampling error. By modeling each participant's accuracy as a function of the level of evidence presented over many repeated judgments, we find that observers are able to correctly infer the underlying trend in samples conveying a lower level of evidence when using HOPs rather than static aggregate uncertainty visualizations as a decision aid.

The features studied were: Gaze (the musicians ignored the participant, the musicians sometimes looked towards and followed the participant's movements), Sound Spatialization (Mono, Stereo, Spatial), Auralization (no sound reflections, reflections corresponding to a room larger than the one perceived, reflections that exactly matched the virtual room), and Environment (no sound from outside of the room, birdsong and wind corresponding to the outside scene). We adopted the methodology based on color matching theory, where 20 participants were first able to assess their feeling of plausibility in the environment with each of the four features at their highest setting. Then five times participants started from a low setting on all features and were able to make transitions from one system configuration to another until they matched their original feeling of plausibility. From these transitions a Markov transition matrix was constructed, and also probabilities of a match conditional on feature configuration.

Yet in the medical domain, both physicians and patients make daily, life-critical judgments based on conditional probability. Although there have been a number of attempts to develop more effective ways to facilitate Bayesian reasoning, reports of these findings tend to be inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory. For instance, the reported accuracies for individuals being able to correctly estimate conditional probability range from 6% to 62%. In this work, we show that problem representation can significantly affect accuracies. By controlling the amount of information presented to the user, we demonstrate how text and visualization designs can increase overall accuracies to as high as 77%. Additionally, we found that for users with high spatial ability, our designs can further improve their accuracies to as high as 100%. By and large, our findings provide explanations for the inconsistent reports on accuracy in Bayesian reasoning tasks and show a significant improvement over existing methods. We believe that these findings can have immediate impact on risk communication in health-related fields.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467758","Keywords":"Bayesian Reasoning;Visualization;Spatial Ability;Individual Differences;Bayesian Reasoning;Visualization;Spatial Ability;Individual Differences"},"218":{"Title":"Smart Brushing for Parallel Coordinates","Authors":"R.

One of the main challenges when using parallel coordinates is occlusion and overplotting resulting from large data sets. Brushing is a popular approach to address these challenges. Since its conception, limited improvements have been made to brushing both in the form of visual design and functional interaction. We present a set of novel, smart brushing techniques that enhance the standard interactive brushing of a parallel coordinates plot. We introduce two new interaction concepts: Higher-order, sketch-based brushing, and smart, data-driven brushing. Higher-order brushes support interactive, flexible, n-dimensional pattern searches involving an arbitrary number of dimensions. Smart, data-driven brushing provides interactive, real-time guidance to the user during the brushing process based on derived meta-data. In addition, we implement a selection of novel enhancements and user options that complement the two techniques as well as enhance the exploration and analytical ability of the user. We demonstrate the utility and evaluate the results using a case study with a large, high-dimensional, real-world telecommunication data set and we report domain expert feedback from the data suppliers.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2808969","Keywords":"Multivariate visualization;parallel coordinates;call center;glyph;brushing;interaction techniques"},"219":{"Title":"Developing Virtual Reality Visualizations for Unsteady Flow Analysis of Dinosaur Track Formation using Scientific Sketching","Authors":"J.

Using Scientific Sketching methodology, we combined input from illustration artists, visualization experts, and domain scientists to create novel visualization methods. By iteratively improving visualization concepts at multiple levels of abstraction we helped domain scientists to gain insights into the relationship between dinosaur foot movements and substrate deformations. We involved over 20 art and computer science students from a VR design course in a rapid visualization sketching cycle, guided by our paleontologist collaborators through multiple critique sessions. This allowed us to explore a wide range of potential visualization methods and select the most promising methods for actual implementation. Our resulting visualization methods provide paleontologists with effective tools to analyze their data through particle, pathline and time surface visualizations. We also introduce a set of visual metaphors to compare foot motion in relation to substrate deformation by using pathsurfaces. This is one of the first large-scale projects using Scientific Sketching as a development methodology.

Users are interested in getting maximal insight into the data by exploring a minimal number of projections. However, if the number is too small or improper projections are used, then important data patterns might be overlooked. We propose a data-driven approach to find minimal sets of projections that uniquely show certain data patterns. For this we introduce a dissimilarity measure of data projections that discards affine transformations of projections and prevents repetitions of the same data patterns. Based on this, we provide complete data tours of at most n\/2 projections. Furthermore, we propose optimal paths of projection matrices for an interactive data exploration.

Occlusion is an important depth cue for 3D perception, yet realizing it on OST-HMDs is particularly difficult due to the displays' semitransparent nature. A key component for the occlusion support is the SLM-a device that can selectively interfere with light rays passing through it. For example, an LCD is a transmissive SLM that can block or pass incoming light rays by turning pixels black or transparent. A straightforward solution places an LCD in front of an OST-HMD and drives the LCD to block light rays that could pass through rendered virtual objects at the viewpoint. This simple approach is, however, defective due to the depth mismatch between the LCD panel and the virtual objects, leading to blurred occlusion. This led existing OST-HMDs to employ dedicated hardware such as focus optics and multi-stacked SLMs. Contrary to these viable, yet complex and\/or computationally expensive solutions, we return to the single-layer LCD approach for the hardware simplicity while maintaining fine occlusion-we compensate for a degraded occlusion area by overlaying a compensation image. We compute the image based on the HMD parameters and the background scene captured by a scene camera. The evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method reduced the occlusion leak error by 61.4% and the occlusion error by 85.7%.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2734427","Keywords":"Occlusion support;optical see-through HMD;occlusion leak;spatial light modulator;depth cue"},"222":{"Title":"SkyLens: Visual Analysis of Skyline on Multi-Dimensional Data","Authors":"X.

By automatically removing incompetent candidates, skyline queries allow users to focus on a subset of superior data items (i.e., the skyline), thus reducing the decision-making overhead. However, users are still required to interpret and compare these superior items manually before making a successful choice. This task is challenging because of two issues. First, people usually have fuzzy, unstable, and inconsistent preferences when presented with multiple candidates. Second, skyline queries do not reveal the reasons for the superiority of certain skyline points in a multi-dimensional space. To address these issues, we propose SkyLens, a visual analytic system aiming at revealing the superiority of skyline points from different perspectives and at different scales to aid users in their decision making. Two scenarios demonstrate the usefulness of SkyLens on two datasets with a dozen of attributes. A qualitative study is also conducted to show that users can efficiently accomplish skyline understanding and comparison tasks with SkyLens.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744738","Keywords":"Skyline query;skyline visualization;multi-dimensional data;visual analytics;multi-criteria decision making"},"223":{"Title":"MyBrush: Brushing and Linking with Personal Agency","Authors":"P.

The objects and their relationships are organized as a heterogeneous graph. We assign each object a set of attributes, based on which a semantic abstraction of the heterogeneous graph is generated. This semantic abstraction is SFG. We design a suite of operations to explore the underlying flow fields based on this graph representation and abstraction mechanism. Users can flexibly reconfigure SFG to examine the relationships among groups of objects at different abstraction levels. Three linked views are developed to display SFG, its node split criteria and history, and the objects in the spatial volume.

This visual inspection is particularly important in exploratory data analysis, where analysts can use visualizations such as histograms and dot plots to identify data quality issues. Yet, these visualizations are driven by parameters such as histogram bin size or mark opacity that have a great deal of impact on the final visual appearance of the chart, but are rarely optimized to make important features visible. In this paper, we show that data flaws have varying impact on the visual features of visualizations, and that the adversarial or merely uncritical setting of design parameters of visualizations can obscure the visual signatures of these flaws. Drawing on the framework of Algebraic Visualization Design, we present the results of a crowdsourced study showing that common visualization types can appear to reasonably summarize distributional data while hiding large and important flaws such as missing data and extraneous modes.

The marching squares (MS) algorithm for isocontour reconstruction generates a linear topology that is consistent with hyperbolic curves of a piecewise bilinear interpolation. The saddle points of the bilinear interpolant cause topological ambiguity in isocontour extraction. The midpoint decider and the asymptotic decider are well-known mathematical techniques for resolving topological ambiguities. The latter technique investigates the data values at the cell saddle points for ambiguity resolution. The uncertainty in data, however, leads to uncertainty in underlying bilinear interpolation functions for the MS algorithm, and hence, their saddle points. In our work, we study the behavior of the asymptotic decider when data at grid vertices is uncertain. First, we derive closed-form distributions characterizing variations in the saddle point values for uncertain bilinear interpolants. The derivation assumes uniform and nonparametric noise models, and it exploits the concept of ratio distribution for analytic formulations. Next, the probabilistic asymptotic decider is devised for ambiguity resolution in uncertain data using distributions of the saddle point values derived in the first step. Finally, the confidence in probabilistic topological decisions is visualized using a colormapping technique. We demonstrate the higher accuracy and stability of the probabilistic asymptotic decider in uncertain data with regard to existing decision frameworks, such as deciders in the mean field and the probabilistic midpoint decider, through the isocontour visualization of synthetic and real datasets.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864505","Keywords":"Isocontour visualization;topological uncertainty;marching squares;asymptotic decider;bilinear interpolation;probabilistic computation"},"228":{"Title":"How Progressive Visualizations Affect Exploratory Analysis","Authors":"E.

By processing data incrementally in small chunks, progressive systems provide approximate query answers at interactive speeds that are then refined over time with increasing precision. We study how progressive visualizations affect users in exploratory settings in an experiment where we capture user behavior and knowledge discovery through interaction logs and think-aloud protocols. Our experiment includes three visualization conditions and different simulated dataset sizes. The visualization conditions are: (1) blocking, where results are displayed only after the entire dataset has been processed; (2) instantaneous, a hypothetical condition where results are shown almost immediately; and (3) progressive, where approximate results are displayed quickly and then refined over time.

The 2D array of voxelizations is compressed using a vector quantization approach. The ray-scene intersection is approximated using the voxelization whose rows are most closely aligned with the ray. The voxelization row that contains the ray is looked up, the row is truncated to the extent of the ray using bit operations, and a truncated row with non-zero bits indicates that the ray intersects the scene. We support dynamic scenes with rigidly moving objects by building a separate 2D array of voxelizations for each type of object, and by using the same 2D array of voxelizations for all instances of an object type. We support complex dynamic scenes and scenes with deforming geometry by computing and rotating a single voxelization on the fly.

In dynamic scenes, object tracking maintains the illusion if the physical and virtual objects are well aligned. However, traditional trackers based on texture or contour information are often distracted by the projected content and tend to fail. In this paper, we present a model-based tracking strategy, which directly takes advantage from the projected content for pose estimation in a projector-camera system. An iterative pose estimation algorithm captures and exploits visible distortions caused by object movements. In a closed-loop, the corrected pose allows the update of the projection for the subsequent frame. Synthetic frames simulating the projection on the model are rendered and an optical flow-based method minimizes the difference between edges of the rendered and the camera image. Since the thresholds automatically adapt to the synthetic image, a complicated radiometric calibration can be avoided. The pixel-wise linear optimization is designed to be easily implemented on the GPU. Our approach can be combined with a regular contour-based tracker and is transferable to other problems, like the estimation of the extrinsic pose between projector and camera.

This comparison is commonly done by extracting scalar information out of the tensor fields and then comparing these scalar fields, which leads to a loss of information. If the glyph representation is kept, simple juxtaposition or superposition can be used. However, neither facilitates the identification and interpretation of the differences between the tensor fields. Inspired by the checkerboard style visualization and the superquadric tensor glyph, we design a new glyph to locally visualize differences between two diffusion tensors by combining juxtaposition and explicit encoding. Because tensor scale, anisotropy type, and orientation are related to anatomical information relevant for DTI applications, we focus on visualizing tensor differences in these three aspects. As demonstrated in a user study, our new glyph design allows users to efficiently and effectively identify the tensor differences. We also apply our new glyphs to investigate the differences between DTI datasets of the human brain in two different contexts using different b-values, and to compare datasets from a healthy and HIV-infected subject.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467435","Keywords":"Glyph Design;Comparative Visualization;Diffusion Tensor Field;Glyph Design;Comparative Visualization;Diffusion Tensor Field"},"242":{"Title":"Deep Neural Representation Guided Face Sketch Synthesis","Authors":"B. Sheng; P. Li; C. Gao; K. Ma","Abstract":"Face sketch synthesis shows great applications in a lot of fields such as online entertainment and suspects identification. Existing face sketch synthesis methods learn the patch-wise sketch style from the training dataset containing photo-sketch pairs. These methods manipulate the whole process directly in the field of RGB space, which unavoidably results in unsmooth noises at patch boundaries. If denoising methods are used, the sketch edges would be blurred and face structures could not be restored. Recent researches of feature maps, which are the outputs of a certain neural network layer, have achieved great success in texture synthesis and artistic image generation. In this paper, we reformulate the face sketch synthesis problem into a neural network feature maps based optimization task. Our results accurately capture the sketch drawing style and make full use of the whole stylistic information hidden in the training dataset. Unlike former feature map based methods, we utilize the Enhanced 3D PatchMatch and cross-layer cost aggregation methods to obtain the target feature maps for the final results. Multiple experiments have shown that our approach imitates hand-drawn sketch style vividly, and has high-quality visual effects on CUHK, AR, XM2VTS and CUFSF face sketch datasets.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2866090","Keywords":"Non-photorealistic rendering;face sketch synthesis;convolutional neural network (CNN);style transformation"},"243":{"Title":"SolarView: Low Distortion Radial Embedding with a Focus","Authors":"T.

Our embedding preserves near-exact distances to the focus entity and aims to minimize distortion between the other entities. We present an interactive exploration tool SolarView which places the focus entity at the center of a \u201csolar system\u201d and embeds its neighbors guided by concentric circles. SolarView provides an implementation of our novel embedding and several state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction and embedding techniques, which we adapted to our setting in various ways. We experimentally evaluated our embedding and compared it to these state-of-the-art techniques. The results show that our embedding competes with these techniques and achieves low distortion in practice. Our method performs particularly well when the visualization, and hence the embedding, adheres to the solar system design principle of our application. Nonetheless-as with all dimensionality reduction techniques-the distortion may be high. We leverage interaction techniques to give clear visual cues that allow users to accurately judge distortion. We illustrate the use of SolarView by exploring the high-dimensional metric space of bibliographic entity similarities.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865361","Keywords":"Dimensionality reduction;radial embedding;visualizing distortion"},"244":{"Title":"Approximated and User Steerable tSNE for Progressive Visual Analytics","Authors":"N.

One key method for data analysis is dimensionality reduction, for example, to produce 2D embeddings that can be visualized and analyzed efficiently. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) is a well-suited technique for the visualization of high-dimensional data. tSNE can create meaningful intermediate results but suffers from a slow initialization that constrains its application in Progressive Visual Analytics. We introduce a controllable tSNE approximation (A-tSNE), which trades off speed and accuracy, to enable interactive data exploration. We offer real-time visualization techniques, including a density-based solution and a Magic Lens to inspect the degree of approximation.

The passive haptic stimuli are provided by small bumps under the feet of users; these stimuli are provided to represent the edges of the stairs in the virtual environment. The visual stimuli of the stairs and shoes, provided by head-mounted displays, evoke a visuo-haptic interaction that modifies a user's perception of the floor shape. Our system enables users to experience all types of stairs, such as half-turn and spiral stairs, in a VR setting. We conducted a preliminary user study and two experiments to evaluate the proposed technique. The preliminary user study investigated the effectiveness of the basic idea associated with the proposed technique for the case of a user ascending stairs. The results demonstrated that the passive haptic feedback produced by the small bumps enhanced the user's feeling of presence and sense of ascending. We subsequently performed an experiment to investigate an improved viewpoint manipulation method and the interaction of the manipulation and haptics for both the ascending and descending cases. The experimental results demonstrated that the participants had a feeling of presence and felt a steep stair gradient under the condition of haptic feedback and viewpoint manipulation based on the characteristics of actual stair walking data. However, these results also indicated that the proposed system may not be as effective in providing a sense of descending stairs without an optimization of the haptic stimuli. We then redesigned the shape of the small bumps, and evaluated the design in a second experiment. The results indicated that the best shape to present haptic stimuli is a right triangle cross section in both the ascending and descending cases. Although it is necessary to install small protrusions in the determined direction, by using this optimized shape the users feeling of presence of the stairs and the sensation of walking up and down was enhanced.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2793038","Keywords":"Virtual reality;locomotion;haptic feedback;perception;stairs;staircase"},"248":{"Title":"HiPiler: Visual Exploration of Large Genome Interaction Matrices with Interactive Small Multiples","Authors":"F.

Genome interaction matrices approximate the physical distance of pairs of regions on the genome to each other and can contain up to 3 million rows and columns with many sparse regions. Regions of interest (ROIs) can be defined, e.g., by sets of adjacent rows and columns, or by specific visual patterns in the matrix. However, traditional matrix aggregation or pan-and-zoom interfaces fail in supporting search, inspection, and comparison of ROIs in such large matrices. In HiPiler, ROIs are first-class objects, represented as thumbnail-like \u201csnippets\u201d. Snippets can be interactively explored and grouped or laid out automatically in scatterplots, or through dimension reduction methods. Snippets are linked to the entire navigable genome interaction matrix through brushing and linking. The design of HiPiler is based on a series of semi-structured interviews with 10 domain experts involved in the analysis and interpretation of genome interaction matrices. We describe six exploration tasks that are crucial for analysis of interaction matrices and demonstrate how HiPiler supports these tasks.

The combination of both these components into telepresence systems, however, comes with significant technical challenges. All approaches proposed so far are extremely demanding on input and output devices, compute resources and transmission bandwidth, and they do not reach the level of immediacy required for applications such as remote collaboration. Here, we introduce what we believe is the first practical client-server system for real-time capture and many-user exploration of static 3D scenes. Our system is based on the observation that interactive frame rates are sufficient for capturing and reconstruction, and real-time performance is only required on the client site to achieve lag-free view updates when rendering the 3D model. Starting from this insight, we extend previous voxel block hashing frameworks by introducing a novel thread-safe GPU hash map data structure that is robust under massively concurrent retrieval, insertion and removal of entries on a thread level. We further propose a novel transmission scheme for volume data that is specifically targeted to Marching Cubes geometry reconstruction and enables a 90% reduction in bandwidth between server and exploration clients. The resulting system poses very moderate requirements on network bandwidth, latency and client-side computation, which enables it to rely entirely on consumer-grade hardware, including mobile devices. We demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art representation accuracy while providing, for any number of clients, an immersive and fluid lag-free viewing experience even during network outages.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2019.2899231","Keywords":"Remote collaboration;live telepresence;real-time reconstruction;voxel hashing;RGB-D;real-time streaming"},"250":{"Title":"A Visual Analytics Framework for Spatiotemporal Trade Network Analysis","Authors":"H.

Recent studies have indicated that changes and disruptions within such networks can serve as indicators for increased risks of violence and armed conflicts. This is especially true of countries that may not be able to compete for scarce commodities during supply shocks. Thus, network-induced vulnerability to supply disruption is typically exported from wealthier populations to disadvantaged populations. As such, researchers and stakeholders concerned with supply chains, political science, environmental studies, etc. need tools to explore the complex dynamics within global trade networks and how the structure of these networks relates to regional instability. However, the multivariate, spatiotemporal nature of the network structure creates a bottleneck in the extraction and analysis of correlations and anomalies for exploratory data analysis and hypothesis generation. Working closely with experts in political science and sustainability, we have developed a highly coordinated, multi-view framework that utilizes anomaly detection, network analytics, and spatiotemporal visualization methods for exploring the relationship between global trade networks and regional instability. Requirements for analysis and initial research questions to be investigated are elicited from domain experts, and a variety of visual encoding techniques for rapid assessment of analysis and correlations between trade goods, network patterns, and time series signatures are explored. We demonstrate the application of our framework through case studies focusing on armed conflicts in Africa, regional instability measures, and their relationship to international global trade.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864844","Keywords":"Global trade network;anomaly detection;visual analytics"},"251":{"Title":"Vulnus: Visual Vulnerability Analysis for Network Security","Authors":"M.

To bring attention to these potentially problematic areas present in the drawing, this paper presents a technique that highlights common types of visual ambiguities: ambiguous spatial relationships between nodes and edges, visual overlap between community structures, and ambiguity in edge bundling and metanodes. Metrics, including newly proposed metrics for abnormal edge lengths, visual overlap in community structures and node\/edge aggregation, are proposed to quantify areas of ambiguity in the drawing. These metrics and others are then displayed using a heatmap-based visualization that provides visual feedback to developers of graph drawing and visualization approaches, allowing them to quickly identify misleading areas.

Resorting to Monte Carlo rendering for such material is usually impractical since recursive importance sampling is inevitable. To reduce the burden of sampling for simulating subsurface scattering and hence improve rendering performance, we adapt the microfacet model to the material with a single thin layer by introducing the extended normal distribution function (ENDF), a new representation of this model, to express visually perceived roughness due to multiple bounces of reflections and refractions. With such a representation, both surface reflection and subsurface scattering can be treated in the same microfacet framework, and the sampling process can be reduced to only once for each bounce of scattering. We derive analytical expressions of the ENDF for several cases using joint spherical warping. We also show how to choose proper shadowing-masking and Fresnel terms to make the proposed bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF) model energy-conserving. Experiments demonstrate that our model can be easily incorporated into a Monte Carlo path tracer with little extra computational and storage overhead, enabling some real-time applications.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2617872","Keywords":"Microfacet;layered material;normal distribution function;BSDF"},"262":{"Title":"Information Olfactation: Harnessing Scent to Convey Data","Authors":"B.

We investigated if and how virtual body ownership (including agency), presence, and emotional response are influenced depending on the specific look of users' avatars, which varied between (1) a generic hand-modeled version, (2) a generic scanned version, and (3) an individualized scanned version. The latter two were created using a state-of-the-art photogrammetry method providing a fast 3D-scan and post-process workflow. Users encountered their avatars in a virtual mirror metaphor using two VR setups that provided a varying degree of immersion, (a) a large screen surround projection (L-shape part of a CAVE) and (b) a head-mounted display (HMD). We found several significant as well as a number of notable effects. First, personalized avatars significantly increase body ownership, presence, and dominance compared to their generic counterparts, even if the latter were generated by the same photogrammetry process and hence could be valued as equal in terms of the degree of realism and graphical quality. Second, the degree of immersion significantly increases the body ownership, agency, as well as the feeling of presence. These results substantiate the value of personalized avatars resembling users' real-world appearances as well as the value of the deployed scanning process to generate avatars for VR-setups where the effect strength might be substantial, e.g., in social Virtual Reality (VR) or in medical VR-based therapies relying on embodied interfaces.

By providing both rich text and movement information, visual analysis on social media data can be both interesting and challenging. In contrast to traditional movement data, the sparseness and irregularity of social media data increase the difficulty of extracting movement patterns. To facilitate the understanding of people's movements, we present an interactive visual analytics system to support the exploration of sparsely sampled trajectory data from social media. We propose a heuristic model to reduce the uncertainty caused by the nature of social media data. In the proposed system, users can filter and select reliable data from each derived movement category, based on the guidance of uncertainty model and interactive selection tools. By iteratively analyzing filtered movements, users can explore the semantics of movements, including the transportation methods, frequent visiting sequences and keyword descriptions. We provide two cases to demonstrate how our system can help users to explore the movement patterns.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467619","Keywords":"Spatial temporal visual analytics;Geo-tagged social media;Sparsely sampling;Uncertainty;Movement;Spatial temporal visual analytics;Geo-tagged social media;Sparsely sampling;Uncertainty;Movement"},"266":{"Title":"Extended LazyNav: Virtual 3D Ground Navigation for Large Displays and Head-Mounted Displays","Authors":"P.

Our mid-air interaction metaphor makes use of only a single pair of the remaining tracked body elements to tailor the navigation. Therefore, the user can navigate in the scene while still being able to perform other interactions with her hands and head, e.g., carrying a bag, grasping a cup of coffee, or observing the content by moving her eyes and locally rotating her head. We design several body motions for navigation by considering the use of non-critical body parts and develop assumptions about ground navigation techniques. Through the user studies, we investigate the motions that are easy to discover, easy to control, socially acceptable, accurate and not tiring. Finally, we evaluate the desired ground navigation features with a prototype application in both a large display (LD) and a HMD navigation scenarios.

MT is a general framework for representing surfaces through variable resolution triangle meshes, while HPDS is a well-spaced random distribution with blue noise characteristics. The distinguishing feature of the HPDS-MT is its ability to extract adaptive meshes whose triangles are guaranteed to have good shape quality. The key idea behind the HPDS-MT is a preprocessed hierarchy of points, which is used in the construction of a MT via incremental simplification. In addition to proving theoretical properties on the shape quality of the triangle meshes extracted by the HPDS-MT, we provide an implementation that computes the HPDS-MT with high accuracy. Our results confirm the theoretical guarantees and outperform similar methods. We also prove that the Hausdorff distance between the original surface and any (extracted) adaptive mesh is bounded by the sampling distribution of the radii of Poisson-disks over the surface. Finally, we illustrate the advantages of the HPDS-MT in some typical problems of geometry processing.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2704078","Keywords":"Multiresolution;poisson disk sampling;triangulation"},"268":{"Title":"Simulation of Textile Stains","Authors":"Y.

To date, considerable effort has been devoted to their distinctive appearance and physically-based simulation. The apperance of staining patterns, commonly seen on textiles, has received comparatively little attention. This paper introduces techniques for simulating staining effects on fabric. Based on the microstructure of yarn, we propose a triple-layer model (TLM) to handle the liquid-yarn interaction for the wetting and wicking computation, and we formalize the liquid spreading in woven cloth into two typical actions, the in-yarn diffusion and the cross-yarn diffusion. The dye diffusion is driven by the liquid diffusion and the concentration distribution of pigments. The warp-weft anisotropy is handled by simulation of the yarn's structure in the two directions. Experimental results demonstrate that a wide range of fabric stain phenomenon on different textile materials, such as the water ring effect, the high saturate stain contour, and the dynamic wash away effect, can be simulated effectively without loss of visual realism. The realism of our simulation results is comparable to effects shown in photographs of real-world examples.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2832039","Keywords":"Fabric appearance;capillary action;simulation;texture"},"269":{"Title":"Example-Based Subspace Stress Analysis for Interactive Shape Design","Authors":"X.

We augment the existing example-based shape editing tools, and propose a fast subspace stress analysis method to enable stress-aware shape editing. In particular, we construct a reduced stress basis from a small set of shape exemplars and possible external forces. This stress basis is automatically adapted to the current user edited shape on the fly, and thereby offers reliable stress estimation. We then introduce a new finite element discretization scheme to use the reduced basis for fast stress analysis. Our method runs up to two orders of magnitude faster than the full-space finite element analysis, with average L2 estimation errors less than 2 percent and maximum L2 errors less than 6 percent. Furthermore, we build an interactive stress-aware shape editing tool to demonstrate its performance in practice.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2618875","Keywords":"Shape editing;elastostatic stress analysis;reduced stress basis;finite element method;shape deformation"},"270":{"Title":"Prescribed Velocity Gradients for Highly Viscous SPH Fluids with Vorticity Diffusion","Authors":"A.

Such approaches allow to explicitly and independently process shear rate, spin, and expansion rate. This can be used to, e.g., avoid interferences between pressure and viscosity solvers. Another interesting aspect is the possibility to explicitly process the vorticity, e.g., to preserve the vorticity. In this context, this paper proposes a novel variant of the prescribed-gradient idea that handles vorticity in a physically motivated way. In contrast to a less appropriate vorticity preservation that has been used in a previous approach, vorticity is diffused. The paper illustrates the utility of the vorticity diffusion. Therefore, comparisons of the proposed vorticity diffusion with vorticity preservation and additionally with vorticity damping are presented. The paper further discusses the relation between prescribed velocity gradients and prescribed velocity Laplacians which improves the intuition behind the prescribed-gradient method for highly viscous SPH fluids. Finally, the paper discusses the relation of the proposed method to a physically correct implicit viscosity formulation.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2636144","Keywords":"Physically based modeling;fluid simulation;smoothed-particle hydrodynamics;viscosity;prescribed velocity gradients"},"271":{"Title":"KAVAGait: Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics for Clinical Gait Analysis","Authors":"M.

Thus, gait rehabilitation is a crucial part of health care systems. The quantification of human locomotion enables clinicians to describe and analyze a patient's gait performance in detail and allows them to base clinical decisions on objective data. These assessments generate a vast amount of complex data which need to be interpreted in a short time period. We conducted a design study in cooperation with gait analysis experts to develop a novel Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics solution for clinical Gait analysis (KAVAGait). KAVAGait allows the clinician to store and inspect complex data derived during clinical gait analysis. The system incorporates innovative and interactive visual interface concepts, which were developed based on the needs of clinicians. Additionally, an explicit knowledge store (EKS) allows externalization and storage of implicit knowledge from clinicians. It makes this information available for others, supporting the process of data inspection and clinical decision making. We validated our system by conducting expert reviews, a user study, and a case study. Results suggest that KAVAGait is able to support a clinician during clinical practice by visualizing complex gait data and providing knowledge of other clinicians.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2785271","Keywords":"Design study;interface design;knowledge generation;knowledge-assisted;visualization;visual analytics;gait analysis"},"272":{"Title":"ColorMapND: A Data-Driven Approach and Tool for Mapping Multivariate Data to Color","Authors":"S.

While a number of methods can map low-dimensional data to color, for example, using bilinear or barycentric interpolation for two or three variables, these methods do not scale to higher data dimensions. Likewise, schemes that take a more artistic approach through color mixing and the like also face limits when it comes to the number of variables they can encode. Our approach does not have these limitations. It is data driven in that it determines a proper and consistent color map from first embedding the data samples into a circular interactive multivariate color mapping display (ICD) and then fusing this display with a convex (CIE HCL) color space. The variables (data attributes) are arranged in terms of their similarity and mapped to the ICD's boundary to control the embedding. Using this layout, the color of a multivariate data sample is then obtained via modified generalized barycentric coordinate interpolation of the map. The system we devised has facilities for contrast and feature enhancement, supports both regular and irregular grids, can deal with multi-field as well as multispectral data, and can produce heat maps, choropleth maps, and diagrams such as scatterplots.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2808489","Keywords":"Multivariate data;color mapping;color space;high dimensional data;pseudo coloring"},"273":{"Title":"Comparing Similarity Perception in Time Series Visualizations","Authors":"A.

This operation is fundamental in high-level tasks, such as detecting recurring phenomena or creating clusters of similar temporal sequences. While automatic measures exist to compute time series similarity, human intervention is often required to visually inspect these automatically generated results. The visualization literature has examined similarity perception and its relation to automatic similarity measures for line charts, but has not yet considered if alternative visual representations, such as horizon graphs and colorfields, alter this perception. Motivated by how neuroscientists evaluate epileptiform patterns, we conducted two experiments that study how these three visualization techniques affect similarity perception in EEG signals. We seek to understand if the time series results returned from automatic similarity measures are perceived in a similar manner, irrespective of the visualization technique; and if what people perceive as similar with each visualization aligns with different automatic measures and their similarity constraints. Our findings indicate that horizon graphs align with similarity measures that allow local variations in temporal position or speed (i.e., dynamic time warping) more than the two other techniques. On the other hand, horizon graphs do not align with measures that are insensitive to amplitude and y-offset scaling (i.e., measures based on z-normalization), but the inverse seems to be the case for line charts and colorfields. Overall, our work indicates that the choice of visualization affects what temporal patterns we consider as similar, i.e., the notion of similarity in time series is not visualization independent.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865077","Keywords":"Time series;similarity perception;automatic similarity search;line charts;horizon graphs;colorfields;evaluation"},"274":{"Title":"DQNViz: A Visual Analytics Approach to Understand Deep Q-Networks","Authors":"J.

As an initial attempt in visualizing DQN models, our work focuses more on Atari games with a simple action space, most notably the Breakout game. From our visual analytics of the agent's experiences, we extract useful action\/reward patterns that help to interpret the model and control the training.

Hadwiger; A. K. Al-Awami; J. Beyer; M. Agus; H. Pfister","Abstract":"Recent advances in data acquisition produce volume data of very high resolution and large size, such as terabyte-sized microscopy volumes. These data often contain many fine and intricate structures, which pose huge challenges for volume rendering, and make it particularly important to efficiently skip empty space. This paper addresses two major challenges: (1) The complexity of large volumes containing fine structures often leads to highly fragmented space subdivisions that make empty regions hard to skip efficiently. (2) The classification of space into empty and non-empty regions changes frequently, because the user or the evaluation of an interactive query activate a different set of objects, which makes it unfeasible to pre-compute a well-adapted space subdivision. We describe the novel SparseLeap method for efficient empty space skipping in very large volumes, even around fine structures. The main performance characteristic of SparseLeap is that it moves the major cost of empty space skipping out of the ray-casting stage. We achieve this via a hybrid strategy that balances the computational load between determining empty ray segments in a rasterization (object-order) stage, and sampling non-empty volume data in the ray-casting (image-order) stage. Before ray-casting, we exploit the fast hardware rasterization of GPUs to create a ray segment list for each pixel, which identifies non-empty regions along the ray. The ray-casting stage then leaps over empty space without hierarchy traversal. Ray segment lists are created by rasterizing a set of fine-grained, view-independent bounding boxes. Frame coherence is exploited by re-using the same bounding boxes unless the set of active objects changes. We show that SparseLeap scales better to large, sparse data than standard octree empty space skipping.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744238","Keywords":"Empty Space Skipping;Volume Rendering;Segmented Volume Data;Hybrid Image\/Object-Order Approaches"},"276":{"Title":"Dynamic Volume Lines: Visual Comparison of 3D Volumes through Space-filling Curves","Authors":"J.

In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Volume Lines for the interactive visual analysis and comparison of sets of 3D volumes. Each volume is linearized along a Hilbert space-filling curve into a 1D Hilbert line plot, which depicts the intensities over the Hilbert indices. We present a nonlinear scaling of these 1D Hilbert line plots based on the intensity variations in the ensemble of 3D volumes, which enables a more effective use of the available screen space. The nonlinear scaling builds the basis for our interactive visualization techniques. An interactive histogram heatmap of the intensity frequencies serves as overview visualization. When zooming in, the frequencies are replaced by detailed 1D Hilbert line plots and optional functional boxplots. To focus on important regions of the volume ensemble, nonlinear scaling is incorporated into the plots. An interactive scaling widget depicts the local ensemble variations. Our brushing and linking interface reveals, for example, regions with a high ensemble variation by showing the affected voxels in a 3D spatial view. We show the applicability of our concepts using two case studies on ensembles of 3D volumes resulting from tomographic reconstruction. In the first case study, we evaluate an artificial specimen from simulated industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography (XCT). In the second case study, a real-world XCT foam specimen is investigated. Our results show that Dynamic Volume Lines can identify regions with high local intensity variations, allowing the user to draw conclusions, for example, about the choice of reconstruction parameters. Furthermore, it is possible to detect ring artifacts in reconstructions volumes.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864510","Keywords":"Ensemble data;comparative visualization;visual analysis;Hilbert curve;nonlinear scaling;X-ray computed tomography"},"277":{"Title":"A Framework for Creative Visualization-Opportunities Workshops","Authors":"E.

The appearance of the marker is designed such that the marker is detected by infrared cameras even when printed on a non-planar surface while its appearance can be diminished by the projection to be as imperceptible as possible to human observers. The marker placement is optimized using a genetic algorithm to maximize the number of valid viewpoints from which the pose of the object can be estimated correctly using a stereo camera system. We also propose a radiometric compensation technique to quickly diminish the marker appearance. Experimental results confirm that the pose of projection objects are correctly estimated while the appearance of the markers was diminished to an imperceptible level. At the same time, we confirmed the limitations of the current method; only one object can be handled, and pose estimation is not performed at interactive frame rates.

We present a method for interactive labeling of crowded 3D scenes containing very many instances of objects spanning multiple scales in size. In contrast to previous labeling methods, we target cases where many instances of dozens of types are present and where the hierarchical structure of the objects in the scene presents an opportunity to choose the most suitable level for each placed label. Our solution builds on and goes beyond labeling techniques in medical 3D visualization, cartography, and biological illustrations from books and prints. In contrast to these techniques, the main characteristics of our new technique are: 1) a novel way of labeling objects as part of a bigger structure when appropriate, 2) visual clutter reduction by labeling only representative instances for each type of an object, and a strategy of selecting those. The appropriate level of label is chosen by analyzing the scene's depth buffer and the scene objects' hierarchy tree. We address the topic of communicating the parent-children relationship between labels by employing visual hierarchy concepts adapted from graphic design. Selecting representative instances considers several criteria tailored to the character of the data and is combined with a greedy optimization approach.

Previous experiments analyzed the human sensitivity to RDW manipulations by focusing on the worst-case scenario, in which users walk perfectly straight ahead in the VE, whereas they are redirected on a circular path in the real world. The results showed that a physical radius of at least 22 meters is required for undetectable RDW. However, users do not always walk exactly straight in a VE. So far, it has not been investigated how much a physical path can be bent in situations in which users walk a virtual curved path instead of a straight one. Such curved walking paths can be often observed, for example, when users walk on virtual trails, through bent corridors, or when circling around obstacles. In such situations the question is not, whether or not the physical path can be bent, but how much the bending of the physical path may vary from the bending of the virtual path. In this article, we analyze this question and present redirection by means of bending gains that describe the discrepancy between the bending of curved paths in the real and virtual environment. Furthermore, we report the psychophysical experiments in which we analyzed the human sensitivity to these gains. The results reveal encouragingly wider detection thresholds than for straightforward walking.

Gamblin","Abstract":"Package managers provide ease of access to applications by removing the time-consuming and sometimes completely prohibitive barrier of successfully building, installing, and maintaining the software for a system. A package dependency contains dependencies between all packages required to build and run the target software. Package management system developers, package maintainers, and users may consult the dependency graph when a simple listing is insufficient for their analyses. However, users working in a remote command line environment must disrupt their workflow to visualize dependency graphs in graphical programs, possibly needing to move files between devices or incur forwarding lag. Such is the case for users of Spack, an open source package management system originally developed to ease the complex builds required by supercomputing environments. To preserve the command line workflow of Spack, we develop an interactive ASCII visualization for its dependency graphs. Through interviews with Spack maintainers, we identify user goals and corresponding visual tasks for dependency graphs. We evaluate the use of our visualization through a command line-centered study, comparing it to the system's two existing approaches. We observe that despite the limitations of the ASCII representation, our visualization is preferred by participants when approached from a command line interface workflow.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2859974","Keywords":"Software visualization;information visualization;command line interface"},"288":{"Title":"TelCoVis: Visual Exploration of Co-occurrence in Urban Human Mobility Based on Telco Data","Authors":"W.

In recent years, the widespread use of mobile phones brings an unprecedented opportunity to capture large-scale and fine-grained data to study co-occurrence in human mobility. However, due to the lack of systematic and efficient methods, it is challenging for analysts to carry out in-depth analyses and extract valuable information. In this paper, we present TelCoVis, an interactive visual analytics system, which helps analysts leverage their domain knowledge to gain insight into the co-occurrence in urban human mobility based on telco data. Our system integrates visualization techniques with new designs and combines them in a novel way to enhance analysts' perception for a comprehensive exploration. In addition, we propose to study the correlations in co-occurrence (i.e. people from multiple regions visit different places during the same time span) by means of biclustering techniques that allow analysts to better explore coordinated relationships among different regions and identify interesting patterns. The case studies based on a real-world dataset and interviews with domain experts have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system in gaining insights into co-occurrence and facilitating various analytical tasks.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467194","Keywords":"Co-occurrence;human mobility;telco data;bicluster;visual analytics;Co-occurrence;human mobility;telco data;bicluster;visual analytics"},"289":{"Title":"Hexahedral Mesh Structure Visualization and Evaluation","Authors":"K.

However, due to various configurations of the singularities in a valid pure hex-mesh, the structure (or base complex) of the mesh can be arbitrarily complex. In this work, we present a first and effective method to help meshing practitioners understand the possible configurations in a valid 3D base complex for the characterization of their complexity. In particular, we propose a strategy to decompose the complex hex-mesh structure into multi-level sub-structures so that they can be studied separately, from which we identify a small set of the sub-structures that can most efficiently represent the whole mesh structure. Furthermore, from this set of sub-structures, we attempt to define the first metric for the quantification of the complexity of hex-mesh structure. To aid the exploration of the extracted multi-level structure information, we devise a visual exploration system coupled with a matrix view to help alleviate the common challenge of 3D data exploration (e.g., clutter and occlusion). We have applied our tool and metric to a large number of hex-meshes generated with different approaches to reveal different characteristics of these methods in terms of the mesh structures they can produce. We also use our metric to assess the existing structure simplification techniques in terms of their effectiveness.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864827","Keywords":"hexahedral mesh;base complex;sheet decomposition;complexity analysis"},"290":{"Title":"Robust Non-Rigid Motion Tracking and Surface Reconstruction Using $L_0$ Regularization","Authors":"K.

The idea is based on the observation that most non-rigid motions (especially human-related motions) are intrinsically involved in articulate motion subspace. To take this advantage, we propose a novel L0 based motion regularizer with an iterative solver that implicitly constrains local deformations with articulate structures, leading to reduced solution space and physical plausible deformations. The L0 strategy is integrated into the available non-rigid motion tracking pipeline, and gradually extracts articulate joints information online with the tracking, which corrects the tracking errors in the results. The information of the articulate joints is used in the following tracking procedure to further improve the tracking accuracy and prevent tracking failures. Extensive experiments over complex human body motions with occlusions, facial and hand motions demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the robustness and accuracy in motion tracking.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2688331","Keywords":"Performance capture, non-rigid, single-view, L0"},"291":{"Title":"Towards Zero-Waste Furniture Design","Authors":"B.

To illustrate the three facets, we have also designed a composite visualization with three visual components: a graph visualization, an uncertainty glyph, and a flow map. The graph visualization with glyphs, the flow map, and the uncertainty analysis together enable analysts to effectively find the most uncertain results and interactively refine them.

However, training DGMs requires more skill, experience, and know-how because their training is more complex than other types of deep models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We develop a visual analytics approach for better understanding and diagnosing the training process of a DGM. To help experts understand the overall training process, we first extract a large amount of time series data that represents training dynamics (e.g., activation changes over time). A blue-noise polyline sampling scheme is then introduced to select time series samples, which can both preserve outliers and reduce visual clutter. To further investigate the root cause of a failed training process, we propose a credit assignment algorithm that indicates how other neurons contribute to the output of the neuron causing the training failure. Two case studies are conducted with machine learning experts to demonstrate how our approach helps understand and diagnose the training processes of DGMs. We also show how our approach can be directly used to analyze other types of deep models, such as CNNs.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744938","Keywords":"deep learning;deep generative models;blue noise sampling;credit assignment"},"294":{"Title":"The Topology ToolKit","Authors":"J.

While topological data analysis has gained in popularity over the last two decades, it has not yet been widely adopted as a standard data analysis tool for end users or developers. TTK aims at addressing this problem by providing a unified, generic, efficient, and robust implementation of key algorithms for the topological analysis of scalar data, including: critical points, integral lines, persistence diagrams, persistence curves, merge trees, contour trees, Morse-Smale complexes, fiber surfaces, continuous scatterplots, Jacobi sets, Reeb spaces, and more. TTK is easily accessible to end users due to a tight integration with ParaView. It is also easily accessible to developers through a variety of bindings (Python, VTK\/C++) for fast prototyping or through direct, dependency-free, C++, to ease integration into pre-existing complex systems. While developing TTK, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. In particular, we present an algorithm for the construction of a discrete gradient that complies to the critical points extracted in the piecewise-linear setting. This algorithm guarantees a combinatorial consistency across the topological abstractions supported by TTK, and importantly, a unified implementation of topological data simplification for multi-scale exploration and analysis. We also present a cached triangulation data structure, that supports time efficient and generic traversals, which self-adjusts its memory usage on demand for input simplicial meshes and which implicitly emulates a triangulation for regular grids with no memory overhead. Finally, we describe an original software architecture, which guarantees memory efficient and direct accesses to TTK features, while still allowing for researchers powerful and easy bindings and extensions.

Identified clusters (i.e., groups of similar members), however, can be very sensitive to small changes of the selected region, so that clustering results can be misleading and bias subsequent analyses. In this article, we - a team of visualization scientists and meteorologists-deliver visual analytics solutions to analyze the sensitivity of clustering results with respect to changes of a selected region. We propose an interactive visual interface that enables simultaneous visualization of a) the variation in composition of identified clusters (i.e., their robustness), b) the variability in cluster membership for individual ensemble members, and c) the uncertainty in the spatial locations of identified trends. We demonstrate that our solution shows meteorologists how representative a clustering result is, and with respect to which changes in the selected region it becomes unstable. Furthermore, our solution helps to identify those ensemble members which stably belong to a given cluster and can thus be considered similar.

Existing methods attempt to achieve several shared optimization goals, such as reducing empty space and minimizing line crossings and wiggles. However, these goals do not always produce optimal results when compared to hand-drawn storylines. We conducted a preliminary study to learn how users translate a narrative into a hand-drawn storyline and check whether the visual elements in hand-drawn illustrations can be mapped back to appropriate narrative contexts.

To cope with this demand we propose a pipeline for the exploration of cyclones and their temporal evolution. This entails a generic framework for their identification and tracking. The fact that depressions and cyclones are not well-defined objects and their shape and size characteristics change over time makes this task especially challenging. Our method combines the robustness of topological approaches and the detailed tracking information from optical flow analysis. At first cyclones are identified within each time step based on well-established topological concepts. Then candidate tracks are computed from an optical flow field. These tracks are clustered within a moving time window to distill dominant coherent cyclone movements, which are then forwarded to a final tracking step. In contrast to previous methods our method requires only a few intuitive parameters. An integration into an exploratory framework helps in the study of cyclone movement by identifying smooth, representative tracks. Multiple case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in tracking cyclones, both in the northern and southern hemisphere.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2810068","Keywords":"Cyclone;scalar field;time-varying data;track graph;spatio-temporal clustering;tracking"},"300":{"Title":"BitExTract: Interactive Visualization for Extracting Bitcoin Exchange Intelligence","Authors":"X.

Evaluations can be time consuming, patients must often travel to metropolitan areas or different cities to see experts, and misdiagnosis can result in improper treatment. To date, only a handful of assistive or remote methods exist to help physicians evaluate patients with suspected neurological disease in a convenient and consistent way. In this paper, we present a low-cost VR interface designed to support evaluation and diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease and test its use in a clinical setting. Using a commercially available VR display with an infrared camera integrated into the lens, we have constructed a 3D virtual environment designed to emulate common tasks used to evaluate patients, such as fixating on a point, conducting smooth pursuit of an object, or executing saccades. These virtual tasks are designed to elicit eye movements commonly associated with neurodegenerative disease, such as abnormal saccades, square wave jerks, and ocular tremor. Next, we conducted experiments with 9 patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and 7 healthy controls to test the system's potential to emulate tasks for clinical diagnosis. We then applied eye tracking algorithms and image enhancement to the eye recordings taken during the experiment and conducted a short follow-up study with two physicians for evaluation.

However, it is important to assess the explanatory power of such models when using them to inform design. We present a secondary analysis of data previously used to rank the effectiveness of bivariate visualizations for assessing correlation (measured with Pearson's r) according to the well-known Weber-Fechner Law. Beginning with the model of Harrison et al. [1], we present a sequence of refinements including incorporation of individual differences, log transformation, censored regression, and adoption of Bayesian statistics. Our model incorporates all observations dropped from the original analysis, including data near ceilings caused by the data collection process and entire visualizations dropped due to large numbers of observations worse than chance. This model deviates from Weber's Law, but provides improved predictive accuracy and generalization. Using Bayesian credibility intervals, we derive a partial ranking that groups visualizations with similar performance, and we give precise estimates of the difference in performance between these groups. We find that compared to other visualizations, scatterplots are unique in combining low variance between individuals and high precision on both positively- and negatively correlated data.

Categorical sequences are similar if they have similar meaning (semantic similarity) and appear in similar time periods (temporal similarity). For data sets with many different categorical sequences, the task to identify similar sequences becomes a challenge.

Our visual interface comprises coupled visualizations of semantics and temporal context for the exploration and assessment of the similarity of categorical sequences.

To lower the barriers in interpreting its recommendations, Duet explains the recommended groups and attributes using both visualizations and textual descriptions.

Combining FTVR with a spherical display enhances the 3D experience with unique properties of the spherical screen such as the enclosing shape, consistent curved surface, and borderless views from all angles around the display. The ability to generate a strong 3D effect on a spherical display with head-tracked rendering is promising for increasing user's performance in 3D tasks. An unanswered question is whether these natural affordances of spherical FTVR displays can improve spatial perception in comparison to traditional flat FTVR displays. To investigate this question, we conducted an experiment to see whether users can perceive the depth and size of virtual objects better on a spherical FTVR display compared to a flat FTVR display on two tasks. Using the spherical display, we found significantly that users had 1cm depth accuracy compared to 6.5cm accuracy using the flat display on a depth-ranking task. Likewise, their performance on a size-matching task was also significantly better with the size error of 2.3mm on the spherical display compared to 3.1mm on the flat display. Furthermore, the perception of size-constancy is stronger on the spherical display than the flat display. This study indicates that the natural affordances provided by the spherical form factor improve depth and size perception in 3D compared to a flat display. We believe that spherical FTVR displays have potential as a 3D virtual environment to provide better task performance for various 3D applications such as 3D designs, scientific visualizations, and virtual surgery.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2019.2898742","Keywords":"Fish tank virtual reality;spherical display;depth cues;3D perception;size constancy;3D visualization"},"308":{"Title":"Efficient Hybrid Image Warping for High Frame-Rate Stereoscopic Rendering","Authors":"A.

While we can automate shading production with the presence of geometry, it is impractical for artists to model the geometry for every single drawing. In this work, we aim to automate shading generation by analyzing the local shapes, connections, and spatial arrangement of wrinkle strokes in a clean line drawing. By this, artists can focus more on the design rather than the tedious manual editing work, and experiment with different shading effects under different conditions. To achieve this, we have made three key technical contributions. First, we model five perceptual cues by exploring relevant psychological principles to estimate the local depth profile around strokes.

These decisions often involve both domain and visualization design expertise, and may impose a tedious specification process that impedes exploration. In this paper, we seek to complement manual chart construction with interactive navigation of a gallery of automatically-generated visualizations. We contribute Voyager, a mixed-initiative system that supports faceted browsing of recommended charts chosen according to statistical and perceptual measures. We describe Voyager's architecture, motivating design principles, and methods for generating and interacting with visualization recommendations. In a study comparing Voyager to a manual visualization specification tool, we find that Voyager facilitates exploration of previously unseen data and leads to increased data variable coverage. We then distill design implications for visualization tools, in particular the need to balance rapid exploration and targeted question-answering.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467191","Keywords":"User interfaces;information visualization;exploratory analysis;visualization recommendation;mixed-initiative systems;User interfaces;information visualization;exploratory analysis;visualization recommendation;mixed-initiative systems"},"311":{"Title":"A Psychophysical Experiment Regarding Components of the Plausibility Illusion","Authors":"R.

Slater proposed Psi and Place Illusion (PI) as orthogonal components of virtual experience which contribute to realistic response in a VE. PI corresponds to the traditional conception of presence as \u201cbeing there,\u201d so there exists a substantial body of previous research relating to PI, but very little relating to Psi. We developed this experiment to investigate the components of plausibility illusion using subjective matching techniques similar to those used in color science. Twenty-one participants each experienced a scenario with the highest level of coherence (the extent to which a scenario matches user expectations and is internally consistent), then in eight different trials chose transitions from lower-coherence to higher-coherence scenarios with the goal of matching the level of Psi they felt in the highest-coherence scenario. At each transition, participants could change one of the following coherence characteristics: the behavior of the other virtual humans in the environment, the behavior of their own body, the physical behavior of objects, or the appearance of the environment. Participants tended to choose improvements to the virtual body before any other improvements. This indicates that having an accurate and well-behaved representation of oneself in the virtual environment is the most important contributing factor to Psi. This study is the first to our knowledge to focus specifically on coherence factors in virtual environments.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2657158","Keywords":"Virtual reality;virtual environments;presence;place illusion;plausibility illusion;immersion;coherence;psychophysics;user studies"},"312":{"Title":"MobilityGraphs: Visual Analysis of Mass Mobility Dynamics via Spatio-Temporal Graphs and Clustering","Authors":"T. von Landesberger; F. Brodkorb; P. Roskosch; N. Andrienko; G. Andrienko; A. Kerren","Abstract":"Learning more about people mobility is an important task for official decision makers and urban planners. Mobility data sets characterize the variation of the presence of people in different places over time as well as movements (or flows) of people between the places. The analysis of mobility data is challenging due to the need to analyze and compare spatial situations (i.e., presence and flows of people at certain time moments) and to gain an understanding of the spatio-temporal changes (variations of situations over time). Traditional flow visualizations usually fail due to massive clutter. Modern approaches offer limited support for investigating the complex variation of the movements over longer time periods. We propose a visual analytics methodology that solves these issues by combined spatial and temporal simplifications. We have developed a graph-based method, called MobilityGraphs, which reveals movement patterns that were occluded in flow maps. Our method enables the visual representation of the spatio-temporal variation of movements for long time series of spatial situations originally containing a large number of intersecting flows. The interactive system supports data exploration from various perspectives and at various levels of detail by interactive setting of clustering parameters. The feasibility our approach was tested on aggregated mobility data derived from a set of geolocated Twitter posts within the Greater London city area and mobile phone call data records in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. We could show that MobilityGraphs support the identification of regular daily and weekly movement patterns of resident population.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2468111","Keywords":"Visual analytics;movement data;networks;graphs;temporal aggregation;spatial aggregation;flows;clustering;Visual analytics;movement data;networks;graphs;temporal aggregation;spatial aggregation;flows;clustering"},"313":{"Title":"Psychological Parameters for Crowd Simulation: From Audiences to Mobs","Authors":"F.

MR360 seamlessly composites 3D virtual objects into a live 360-video using the input panoramic video as the lighting source to illuminate the virtual objects. Image based lighting (IBL) is perceptually optimized to provide fast and believable results using the LDR 360-video as the lighting source. Regions of most salient lights in the input panoramic video are detected to optimize the number of lights used to cast perceptible shadows. Then, the areas of the detected lights adjust the penumbra of the shadow to provide realistic soft shadows. Finally, our real-time differential rendering synthesizes illumination of the virtual 3D objects into the 360-video. MR360 provides the illusion of interacting with objects in a video, which are actually 3D virtual objects seamlessly composited into the background of the 360-video. MR360 was implemented in a commercial game engine and tested using various 360-videos.

Abbasloo; V. Wiens; M. Hermann; T.

A recently proposed tensorial normal distribution, involving a fourth order covariance tensor, provides a mathematical description of how different aspects of the tensor field, such as trace, anisotropy, or orientation, vary and covary at each point. However, this wealth of information is far too rich for a human analyst to take in at a single glance, and no suitable visualization tools are available. We propose a novel approach that facilitates visual analysis of tensor covariance at multiple levels of detail. We start with a visual abstraction that uses slice views and direct volume rendering to indicate large-scale changes in the covariance structure, and locations with high overall variance. We then provide tools for interactive exploration, making it possible to drill down into different types of variability, such as in shape or orientation. Finally, we allow the analyst to focus on specific locations of the field, and provide tensor glyph animations and overlays that intuitively depict confidence intervals at those points. Our system is demonstrated by investigating the effects of measurement noise on diffusion tensor MRI, and by analyzing two ensembles of stress tensor fields from solid mechanics.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467031","Keywords":"Uncertainty visualization;tensor visualization;direct volume rendering;interaction;glyph based visualization;Uncertainty visualization;tensor visualization;direct volume rendering;interaction;glyph based visualization"},"317":{"Title":"VERAM: View-Enhanced Recurrent Attention Model for 3D Shape Classification","Authors":"S.

However, the fusion of multi-view features based on max or average pooling lacks a view selection mechanism, limiting its application in, e.g., multi-view active object recognition by a robot. This paper presents VERAM, a view-enhanced recurrent attention model capable of actively selecting a sequence of views for highly accurate 3D shape classification. VERAM addresses an important issue commonly found in existing attention-based models, i.e., the unbalanced training of the subnetworks corresponding to next view estimation and shape classification. The classification subnetwork is easily overfitted while the view estimation one is usually poorly trained, leading to a suboptimal classification performance. This is surmounted by three essential view-enhancement strategies: 1) enhancing the information flow of gradient backpropagation for the view estimation subnetwork, 2) devising a highly informative reward function for the reinforcement training of view estimation and 3) formulating a novel loss function that explicitly circumvents view duplication. Taking grayscale image as input and AlexNet as CNN architecture, VERAM with 9 views achieves instance-level and class-level accuracy of 95.5 and 95.3 percent on ModelNet10, 93.7 and 92.1 percent on ModelNet40, both are the state-of-the-art performance under the same number of views.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2866793","Keywords":"3D shape classification;multi-view 3D shape recognition;visual attention model;recurrent neural network;reinforcement learning;convolutional neural network"},"318":{"Title":"Objective Quality Prediction of Image Retargeting Algorithms","Authors":"Y.

A common problem of single scattering is the high dynamic range between lit and shadowed regions due to the exponential attenuation of light along a ray. Moreover, light is often attenuated too strong between a sample point and the camera, hampering the visibility of important features. Our algorithm employs an importance function to selectively illuminate important structures and make them visible from the camera. With the importance function, more light can be transmitted to the features of interest, while contextual structures cast shadows which provide visual cues for perception of depth. At the same time, more scattered light is transmitted from the sample point to the camera to improve the primary visibility of important features. We formulate a minimization problem that automatically determines the extinction along a view or shadow ray to obtain a good balance between sufficient transmittance and attenuation. In contrast to previous approaches, we do not require a computationally expensive solution of a global optimization, but instead provide a closed-form solution for each sampled extinction value along a view or shadow ray and thus achieve interactive performance.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2569080","Keywords":"Direct volume rendering;volume illumination;extinction optimization"},"320":{"Title":"IDMVis: Temporal Event Sequence Visualization for Type 1 Diabetes Treatment Decision Support","Authors":"Y.

Researchers across the fields of data science, visualization, and human-computer interaction are calling for foundational tools and principles that could be applied to assessing the effectiveness of data visualizations in a more rapid and generalizable manner. One possibility for such a tool is a model of visual saliency for data visualizations. Visual saliency models are typically based on the properties of the human visual cortex and predict which areas of a scene have visual features (e.g. color, luminance, edges) that are likely to draw a viewer's attention. While these models can accurately predict where viewers will look in a natural scene, they typically do not perform well for abstract data visualizations. In this paper, we discuss the reasons for the poor performance of existing saliency models when applied to data visualizations. We introduce the Data Visualization Saliency (DVS) model, a saliency model tailored to address some of these weaknesses, and we test the performance of the DVS model and existing saliency models by comparing the saliency maps produced by the models to eye tracking data obtained from human viewers. Finally, we describe how modified saliency models could be used as general tools for assessing the effectiveness of visualizations, including the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2743939","Keywords":"Visual saliency;evaluation;eye tracking"},"322":{"Title":"Correlation Judgment and Visualization Features: A Comparative Study","Authors":"F.

In this paper, we investigate a longstanding hypothesis that people use visual features in a chart as a proxy for statistical measures like correlation. For a given scatterplot, we extract 49 candidate visual features and evaluate which best align with existing models and participant judgments. The results support the hypothesis that people attend to a small number of visual features when discriminating correlation in scatterplots.

Self-contact is in particular a strong source of passive haptic feedback and we assume it to bring a clear benefit in terms of embodiment. For evaluating this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulate self-contacts and the virtual hand displacement relatively to the body. We introduce these body posture transformations to experimentally reproduce the imperfect or incorrect mapping between real and virtual bodies, with the goal of quantifying the limits of acceptance for distorted mapping on the reported body ownership and agency. We first describe how we exploit egocentric coordinate representations to perform a motion capture ensuring that real and virtual hands coincide whenever the real hand is in contact with the body. Then, we present a pilot study that focuses on quantifying our sensitivity to visuo-tactile mismatches. The results are then used to design our main study with two factors, offset (for self-contact) and amplitude (for movement amplification).

However, panoramas lack motion parallax as they do not provide different views for different viewpoints. The motion parallax induced by translational head motion is a crucial depth cue in daily life. Alternatives, such as omnidirectional stereo panoramas, provide different views for each eye (binocular disparity), but they also lack motion parallax as the left and right eye panoramas are stitched statically. Methods based on explicit scene geometry reconstruct textured 3D geometry, which provides motion parallax, but suffers from visible reconstruction artefacts. The core of our method is a novel multi-perspective panorama representation, which can be casually captured and rendered with motion parallax for each eye on the fly. This provides a more realistic perception of panoramic environments which is particularly useful for virtual reality applications. Our approach uses a single consumer video camera to acquire 200-400 views of a real 360\u00b0 environment with a single sweep. By using novel-view synthesis with flow-based blending, we show how to turn these input views into an enriched 360\u00b0 panoramic experience that can be explored in real time, without relying on potentially unreliable reconstruction of scene geometry. We compare our results with existing omnidirectional stereo and image-based rendering methods to demonstrate the benefit of our approach, which is the first to enable casual consumers to capture and view high-quality 360\u00b0 panoramas with motion parallax.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2019.2898799","Keywords":"Casual 360\u00b0 scene capture;plenoptic modeling;image-based rendering;novel-view synthesis;virtual reality"},"331":{"Title":"Extrafoveal Video Extension for an Immersive Viewing Experience","Authors":"L.

Head-mounted Display (HMD) devices are often used to afford users a feeling of immersion in the environment. Another technique is to project additional material surrounding the viewer, as is achieved using cave systems. As a continuation of this technique, it could be interesting to extend surrounding projection to current television or cinema screens. The idea would be to entirely fill the viewer's field of vision, thus providing them with a more complete feeling of being in the scene and part of the story. The appropriate content can be captured using large field of view (FoV) technology, using a rig of cameras for 1100 to 3600 capture, or created using computer-generated images. The FoV is, however, rather limited in its use for existing (legacy) content, achieving between 36 to 90 degrees (0) field, depending on the distance from the screen. This paper seeks to improve this FoV limitation by proposing computer vision techniques to extend such legacy content to the peripheral (extrafoveal) vision without changing the original creative intent or damaging the viewer's experience. A new methodology is also proposed for performing user tests in order to evaluate the quality of the experience and confirm that the sense of immersion has been increased. This paper thus presents: i) an algorithm to spatially extend the video based on human vision characteristics, ii) its subjective results compared to state-of-the-art techniques, iii) the protocol required to evaluate the quality of the experience (QoE), and iv) the results of the user tests.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2527649","Keywords":"Augmented video;large field of view;human vision;immersion"},"332":{"Title":"Adaptive Multilinear Tensor Product Wavelets","Authors":"K.

This allows for an adaptive, sparse representation of the function with on-demand evaluation at any point in the domain.

Chen; P. Xu; L. Ren","Abstract":"Event sequences analysis plays an important role in many application domains such as customer behavior analysis, electronic health record analysis and vehicle fault diagnosis. Real-world event sequence data is often noisy and complex with high event cardinality, making it a challenging task to construct concise yet comprehensive overviews for such data. In this paper, we propose a novel visualization technique based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle to construct a coarse-level overview of event sequence data while balancing the information loss in it. The method addresses a fundamental trade-off in visualization design: reducing visual clutter vs. increasing the information content in a visualization. The method enables simultaneous sequence clustering and pattern extraction and is highly tolerant to noises such as missing or additional events in the data. Based on this approach we propose a visual analytics framework with multiple levels-of-detail to facilitate interactive data exploration. We demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our approach through case studies with two real-world datasets. One dataset showcases a new application domain for event sequence visualization, i.e., fault development path analysis in vehicles for predictive maintenance. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed method based on user feedback.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2745083","Keywords":"Time Series Data;Data Transformation and Representation;Visual Knowledge Representation;Visual Analytics"},"335":{"Title":"A Heuristic Approach to Value-Driven Evaluation of Visualizations","Authors":"E.

The value equation contains components for the time savings a visualization provides, the insights and insightful questions it spurs, the overall essence of the data it conveys, and the confidence about the data and its domain it inspires. This articulation of value is purely descriptive, however, providing no actionable method of assessing a visualization's value. In this work, we create a heuristic-based evaluation methodology to accompany the value equation for assessing interactive visualizations. We refer to the methodology colloquially as ICE-T, based on an anagram of the four value components. Our approach breaks the four components down into guidelines, each of which is made up of a small set of low-level heuristics. Evaluators who have knowledge of visualization design principles then assess the visualization with respect to the heuristics. We conducted an initial trial of the methodology on three interactive visualizations of the same data set, each evaluated by 15 visualization experts. We found that the methodology showed promise, obtaining consistent ratings across the three visualizations and mirroring judgments of the utility of the visualizations by instructors of the course in which they were developed.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865146","Keywords":"Visualization evaluation;heuristics;value of visualization"},"336":{"Title":"ActiVis: Visual Exploration of Industry-Scale Deep Neural Network Models","Authors":"M.

Discoveries and concepts in biology are typically summarized with illustrations assembled manually from the interpretation and application of heterogenous data. The creation of such illustrations is time consuming, which makes it incompatible with frequent updates to the measured data as new discoveries are made. Illustrations are typically non-interactive, and when an illustration is updated, it still has to reach the user. Our system is designed to overcome these three obstacles. It supports the integration of heterogeneous datasets, reflecting the knowledge that is gained from different data sources in biology. After pre-processing the datasets, the system transforms them into visual representations as inspired by scientific illustrations. As opposed to traditional scientific illustration these representations are generated in real-time - they are interactive. The code generating the visualizations can be embedded in various software environments. To demonstrate this, we implemented both a desktop application and a remote-rendering server in which the pipeline is embedded. The remote-rendering server supports multi-threaded rendering and it is able to handle multiple users simultaneously. This scalability to different hardware environments, including multi-GPU setups, makes our system useful for efficient public dissemination of biological discoveries.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744518","Keywords":"Biological visualization;remote rendering;public dissemination"},"341":{"Title":"Evaluating Remapped Physical Reach for Hand Interactions with Passive Haptics in Virtual Reality","Authors":"D.

To increase realism and allow direct hand interaction, real-world physical objects can be aligned with virtual objects to provide tactile feedback and physical grasping. However, unless a physical space is custom configured to match a specific virtual reality experience, the ability to perfectly match the physical and virtual objects is limited. Our research addresses this challenge by studying methods that allow one physical object to be mapped to multiple virtual objects that can exist at different virtual locations in an egocentric reference frame. We study two such techniques: one that introduces a static translational offset between the virtual and physical hand before a reaching action, and one that dynamically interpolates the position of the virtual hand during a reaching motion. We conducted two experiments to assess how the two methods affect reaching effectiveness, comfort, and ability to adapt to the remapping techniques when reaching for objects with different types of mismatches between physical and virtual locations. We also present a case study to demonstrate how the hand remapping techniques could be used in an immersive game application to support realistic hand interaction while optimizing usability. Overall, the translational technique performed better than the interpolated reach technique and was more robust for situations with larger mismatches between virtual and physical objects.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2794659","Keywords":"Virtual reality;3D interaction;passive haptics;hand interaction;remapped reach;3D object selection"},"342":{"Title":"Dynamic Composite Data Physicalization Using Wheeled Micro-Robots","Authors":"M.

In this paper, we propose a novel visual summarization technique for bipartite graphs based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The method simultaneously groups the two different set of nodes and constructs aggregated bipartite relations with balanced granularity and precision. It addresses the key trade-off that often occurs for visualizing large scale and noisy data: acquiring a clear and uncluttered overview while maximizing the information content in it. We formulate the visual summarization task as a co-clustering problem and propose an efficient algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH) that can easily scale to large graphs under reasonable interactive time constraints that previous related methods cannot satisfy. The method leads to the opportunity of introducing a visual analytics framework with multiple levels-of-detail to facilitate interactive data exploration. In the framework, we also introduce a compact visual design inspired by adjacency list representation of graphs as the building block for a small multiples display to compare the bipartite relations for different subsets of data. We showcase the applicability and effectiveness of our approach by applying it on synthetic data with ground truth and performing case studies on real-world datasets from two application domains including roll-call vote record analysis and vehicle fault pattern analysis.

Thus, vertex data are preferably compressed, with a requirement that they can be decompressed during rendering. In this paper, we present a novel method to exploit existing hardware texture compression circuits to facilitate the decompression of vertex data in graphics processing unit (GPUs). This built-in hardware allows real-time, random-order decoding of data. However, vertex data must be packed into textures, and careless packing arrangements can easily disrupt data coherence. Hence, we propose an optimization approach for the best vertex data permutation that minimizes compression error. All of these result in fast and high-quality vertex data decompression for real-time rendering. To further improve the visual quality, we introduce vertex clustering to reduce the dynamic range of data during quantization. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for various vertex data of 3D models during rendering with the advantages of a minimized memory footprint and high frame rate.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2695182","Keywords":"Vertex data compression;real-time rendering;hardware texture compression;permutation;GPU acceleration"},"346":{"Title":"TPFlow: Progressive Partition and Multidimensional Pattern Extraction for Large-Scale Spatio-Temporal Data Analysis","Authors":"D.

A typical approach to explore such data utilizes interactive visualizations with multiple coordinated views. Each view displays the aggregated measures along one or two dimensions. By brushing on the views, analysts can obtain detailed information. However, this approach often cannot provide sufficient guidance for analysts to identify patterns hidden within subsets of data. Without a priori hypotheses, analysts need to manually select and iterate through different slices to search for patterns, which can be a tedious and lengthy process. In this work, we model multidimensional ST data as tensors and propose a novel piecewise rank-one tensor decomposition algorithm which supports automatically slicing the data into homogeneous partitions and extracting the latent patterns in each partition for comparison and visual summarization. The algorithm optimizes a quantitative measure about how faithfully the extracted patterns visually represent the original data. Based on the algorithm we further propose a visual analytics framework that supports a top-down, progressive partitioning workflow for level-of-detail multidimensional ST data exploration.

The directions of traffic flows are visualized using a particle system on top of the density map. The user can extract traffic flows using a novel selection widget that allows for the intuitive selection of an area, and filtering on a range of directions and any additional attributes. Using simple, visual set expressions, the user can construct more complicated selections. The dynamic behaviors of selected flows may then be shown in annotation windows in which they can be interactively explored and compared.

Ma; A. Entezari","Abstract":"Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) ensembles are commonly used to assess the uncertainty and confidence in weather forecasts. Spaghetti plots are conventional tools for meteorologists to directly examine the uncertainty exhibited by ensembles, where they simultaneously visualize isocontours of all ensemble members. To avoid visual clutter in practical usages, one needs to select a small number of informative isovalues for visual analysis. Moreover, due to the complex topology and variation of ensemble isocontours, it is often a challenging task to interpret the spaghetti plot for even a single isovalue in large ensembles. In this paper, we propose an interactive framework for uncertainty visualization of weather forecast ensembles that significantly improves and expands the utility of spaghetti plots in ensemble analysis. Complementary to state-of-the-art methods, our approach provides a complete framework for visual exploration of ensemble isocontours, including isovalue selection, interactive isocontour variability exploration, and interactive sub-region selection and re-analysis. Our framework is built upon the high-density clustering paradigm, where the mode structure of the density function is represented as a hierarchy of nested subsets of the data. We generalize the high-density clustering for isocontours and propose a bandwidth selection method for estimating the density function of ensemble isocontours. We present novel visualizations based on high-density clustering results, called the mode plot and the simplified spaghetti plot. The proposed mode plot visually encodes the structure provided by the high-density clustering result and summarizes the distribution of ensemble isocontours. It also enables the selection of subsets of interesting isocontours, which are interactively highlighted in a linked spaghetti plot for providing spatial context. To provide an interpretable overview of the positional variability of isocontours, our system allows for selection of informative isovalues from the simplified spaghetti plot. Due to the spatial variability of ensemble isocontours, the system allows for interactive selection and focus on sub-regions for local uncertainty and clustering re-analysis. We examine a number of ensemble datasets to establish the utility of our approach and discuss its advantages over state-of-the-art visual analysis tools for ensemble data.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864815","Keywords":"Spaghetti plots;ensemble visualization;uncertainty visualization;high-density clustering;ensemble forecasting"},"349":{"Title":"Fast and Exact Fiber Surfaces for Tetrahedral Meshes","Authors":"P.

Recent work has generalized them to bivariate volumetric fields with fiber surfaces, the pre-image of polygons in range space. However, the existing algorithm for their computation is approximate, and is limited to closed polygons. Moreover, its runtime performance does not allow instantaneous updates of the fiber surfaces upon user edits of the polygons. Overall, these limitations prevent a reliable and interactive exploration of the space of fiber surfaces. This paper introduces the first algorithm for the exact computation of fiber surfaces in tetrahedral meshes. It assumes no restriction on the topology of the input polygon, handles degenerate cases and better captures sharp features induced by polygon bends. The algorithm also allows visualization of individual fibers on the output surface, better illustrating their relationship with data features in range space. To enable truly interactive exploration sessions, we further improve the runtime performance of this algorithm. In particular, we show that it is trivially parallelizable and that it scales nearly linearly with the number of cores. Further, we study acceleration data-structures both in geometrical domain and range space and we show how to generalize interval trees used in isosurface extraction to fiber surface extraction. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over previous work, both in terms of accuracy and running time, with up to two orders of magnitude speedups. This improvement enables interactive edits of range polygons with instantaneous updates of the fiber surface for exploration purpose. A VTK-based reference implementation is provided as additional material to reproduce our results.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2570215","Keywords":"Bivariate data;data segmentation;data analysis;isosurfaces;continuous scatterplot"},"350":{"Title":"Supporting Iterative Cohort Construction with Visual Temporal Queries","Authors":"J.

Upon this difference-based encoding scheme, every vertex position of a target grid is subsequently determined after optimizing the one-dimensional values. Our quad edge-based grid model has two major advantages for image retargeting. First, the model enables a grid optimization problem to be developed in a simple quadratic program while ensuring the global convexity of objective functions. Second, due to the independency of variables, spatial regularizations can be applied in a locally adaptive manner to preserve structural components. Based on this model, we propose three quadratic objective functions. Note that, in our work, their linear combination guides a grid deformation process to obtain a visually comfortable retargeting result by preserving salient regions and structural components of an input image. Comparative evaluations have been conducted with ten existing state-of-the-art image retargeting methods, and the results show that our method built upon the quad edge-based model consistently outperforms other previous methods both on qualitative and quantitative perspectives.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2866106","Keywords":"Image retargeting;2D grid deformation;saliency detection;line segment detection;image quality assessment"},"354":{"Title":"Vistrates: A Component Model for Ubiquitous Analytics","Authors":"S.

J. Tan; N. Navab; F. Tombari","Abstract":"3D object temporal trackers estimate the 3D rotation and 3D translation of a rigid object by propagating the transformation from one frame to the next. To confront this task, algorithms either learn the transformation between two consecutive frames or optimize an energy function to align the object to the scene. The motivation behind our approach stems from a consideration on the nature of learners and optimizers. Throughout the evaluation of different types of objects and working conditions, we observe their complementary nature - on one hand, learners are more robust when undergoing challenging scenarios, while optimizers are prone to tracking failures due to the entrapment at local minima; on the other, optimizers can converge to a better accuracy and minimize jitter. Therefore, we propose to bridge the gap between learners and optimizers to attain a robust and accurate RGB-D temporal tracker that runs at approximately 2 ms per frame using one CPU core. Our work is highly suitable for Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications due to its robustness, accuracy, efficiency and low latency. Aiming at stepping beyond the simple scenarios used by current systems, often constrained by having a single object in the absence of clutter, averting to touch the object to prevent close-range partial occlusion or selecting brightly colored objects to easily segment them individually, we demonstrate the capacity to handle challenging cases under clutter, partial occlusion and varying lighting conditions.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2734539","Keywords":"3D Tracking;Random Forest;6D Pose Estimation"},"360":{"Title":"Wide Field Of View Varifocal Near-Eye Display Using See-Through Deformable Membrane Mirrors","Authors":"D.

We tackle this problem by introducing an all-in-one solution - a new wide field of view, gaze-tracked near-eye display for augmented reality applications. The key component of our solution is the use of a single see-through, varifocal deformable membrane mirror for each eye reflecting a display. They are controlled by airtight cavities and change the effective focal power to present a virtual image at a target depth plane which is determined by the gaze tracker. The benefits of using the membranes include wide field of view (100\u00b0 diagonal) and fast depth switching (from 20 cm to infinity within 300 ms).

Topic models enable one to mine cross-sectional patient comorbidity data (e.g., electronic health records) and construct disease subtypes-each with its own temporally evolving prevalence and co-occurrence of phenotypes-without requiring aligned longitudinal phenotype data for all patients. However, the dimensionality of topic models makes interpretation challenging, and de facto analyses provide little intuition regarding phenotype relevance or phenotype interrelationships. PhenoLines enables one to compare phenotype prevalence within and across disease subtype topics, thus supporting subtype characterization, a task that involves identifying a proposed subtype's dominant phenotypes, ages of effect, and clinical validity. We contribute a data transformation workflow that employs the Human Phenotype Ontology to hierarchically organize phenotypes and aggregate the evolving probabilities produced by topic models. We introduce a novel measure of phenotype relevance that can be used to simplify the resulting topology. The design of PhenoLines was motivated by formative interviews with machine learning and clinical experts. We describe the collaborative design process, distill high-level tasks, and report on initial evaluations with machine learning experts and a medical domain expert. These results suggest that PhenoLines demonstrates promising approaches to support the characterization and optimization of topic models.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2745118","Keywords":"Developmental disorder;Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO);Phenotypes;Topic models;Topology simplification"},"362":{"Title":"Image-Based Models for Specularity Propagation in Diminished Reality","Authors":"S.

In our approach, the area of the target object is replaced with new texture that blends with the rest of the image. The result is then propagated to the next frames of the video. One of the important stages of this technique is to update the target region with respect to the illumination change. This is a complex and recurrent problem when the viewpoint changes. We show that the state-of-the-art in DR fails in solving this problem, even under simple scenarios. We then use local illumination models to address this problem. According to these models, the variation in illumination only affects the specular component of the image. In the context of DR, the problem is therefore solved by propagating the specularities in the target area. We list a set of structural properties of specularities which we incorporate in two new models for specularity propagation. Our first model includes the same property as the previous approaches, which is the smoothness of illumination variation, but has a different estimation method based on the Thin-Plate Spline. Our second model incorporates more properties of the specularity's shape on planar surfaces. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our strategy substantially improves the rendering quality compared to the state-of-the-art in DR.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2705687","Keywords":"Diminished reality;specularity;propagation;rendering;isocontours;brightest point;illumination variation"},"363":{"Title":"Widening Viewing Angles of Automultiscopic Displays Using Refractive Inserts","Authors":"G.

Some multiscopic displays enable realistic perception of 3D environments without the need for cumbersome mounts or fragile head-tracking algorithms. These automultiscopic displays carefully control the distribution of emitted light over space, direction (angle) and time so that even a static image displayed can encode parallax across viewing directions (Iightfield). This allows simultaneous observation by multiple viewers, each perceiving 3D from their own (correct) perspective. Currently, the illusion can only be effectively maintained over a narrow range of viewing angles. In this paper, we propose and analyze a simple solution to widen the range of viewing angles for automultiscopic displays that use parallax barriers. We propose the use of a refractive medium, with a high refractive index, between the display and parallax barriers. The inserted medium warps the exitant lightfield in a way that increases the potential viewing angle. We analyze the consequences of this warp and build a prototype with a 93% increase in the effective viewing angle.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2794599","Keywords":"Automultiscopic displays;lightfields"},"364":{"Title":"Drag and Track: A Direct Manipulation Interface for Contextualizing Data Instances within a Continuous Parameter Space","Authors":"D.

Our goals are two-fold: first, to build a user-directed intuition of dimensionally reduced data, and second, to provide a mechanism for creatively exploring parameter relationships in parameterized simulation sets, called ensembles. We start by visualizing ensemble data instances in dimensionally reduced scatter plots. To understand these abstract views, we employ user-defined virtual data instances that, through direct manipulation, search an ensemble for similar instances. Users can create multiple of these direct manipulation queries to visually annotate the spaces with sets of highlighted ensemble data instances. User-defined goals are therefore translated into custom illustrations that are projected onto the dimensionally reduced spaces. Combined forward and inverse searches of the parameter space follow naturally allowing for continuous parameter space prediction and visual query comparison in the context of an ensemble. The potential for this visualization technique is confirmed via expert user feedback for a shock physics application and synthetic model analysis.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865051","Keywords":"Visual Parameter Space Analysis;Ensemble Visualization;Semantic Interaction;Direct Manipulation;Shock Physics"},"365":{"Title":"Realistic Data-Driven Traffic Flow Animation Using Texture Synthesis","Authors":"Q.

The synthesized output captures the spatio-temporal dynamics of the input traffic flows, and the vehicle interactions in it strictly follow traffic rules. After that, we position the synthesized vehicle trajectory data to virtual road networks using a cage-based registration scheme, where a few traffic-specific constraints are enforced to maintain each vehicle's original spatial location and synchronize its motion in concert with its neighboring vehicles.

Despite the strong performance of RNNs, it is often challenging for users to understand why the model makes a particular prediction. Such black-box nature of RNNs can impede its wide adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, we have no established methods to interactively leverage users' domain expertise and prior knowledge as inputs for steering the model. Therefore, our design study aims to provide a visual analytics solution to increase interpretability and interactivity of RNNs via a joint effort of medical experts, artificial intelligence scientists, and visual analytics researchers. Following the iterative design process between the experts, we design, implement, and evaluate a visual analytics tool called RetainVis, which couples a newly improved, interpretable, and interactive RNN-based model called RetainEX and visualizations for users' exploration of EMR data in the context of prediction tasks. Our study shows the effective use of RetainVis for gaining insights into how individual medical codes contribute to making risk predictions, using EMRs of patients with heart failure and cataract symptoms.

The simulation results support lighting designers in the creation of lighting configurations, which must meet contradicting customer objectives regarding quality and price while conforming to industry standards. However, current tools for lighting design impede rapid feedback cycles. On the one side, they decouple analysis and simulation specification. On the other side, they lack capabilities for a detailed comparison of multiple configurations. The primary contribution of this paper is a design study of LiteVis, a system for efficient decision support in lighting design. LiteVis tightly integrates global illumination-based lighting simulation, a spatial representation of the scene, and non-spatial visualizations of parameters and result indicators. This enables an efficient iterative cycle of simulation parametrization and analysis. Specifically, a novel visualization supports decision making by ranking simulated lighting configurations with regard to a weight-based prioritization of objectives that considers both spatial and non-spatial characteristics. In the spatial domain, novel concepts support a detailed comparison of illumination scenarios.

In this work, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine graph spectral processing approach that exploits the fact that the sharp features reside in a low dimensional structure hidden in the noisy 3D dataset. In the coarse step, the mesh is processed in parts, using a model based Bayesian learning method that identifies the noise level in each part and the subspace where the features lie.

That is, understanding the axes and interacting with them to make adjustments can be challenging. In this paper, we present InterAxis, a visual analytics technique to properly interpret, define, and change an axis in a user-driven manner. Users are given the ability to define and modify axes by dragging data items to either side of the x or y axes, from which the system computes a linear combination of data attributes and binds it to the axis. Further, users can directly tune the positive and negative contribution to these complex axes by using the visualization of data attributes that correspond to each axis.

A gaze stripe consists of a sequence of such gaze point images, oriented along a horizontal timeline. By displaying multiple aligned gaze stripes, it is possible to analyze and compare the viewing behavior of the participants over time. Since the analysis is carried out directly on the image data, expensive post-processing or manual annotation are not required. Therefore, not only patterns and outliers in the participants' scanpaths can be detected, but the context of the stimulus is available as well. Furthermore, our approach is especially well suited for dynamic stimuli due to the non-aggregated temporal mapping. Complementary views, i.e., markers, notes, screenshots, histograms, and results from automatic clustering, can be added to the visualization to display analysis results.

Such a semi-explicit surface mechanism can preserve volume, fine features and foam-like thin films under a relatively low computational expenditure. Our method processes the surface evolution by sampling the fluid domain onto a spectrally refined grid (SRG) and performs efficient grid scanning, generalized interpolations and topology operations on the basis of this grid structure. For the RLS surface part, we propose an accurate advection scheme targeted at SRG. For the explicit mesh part, we develop a fast grid-scanning technique to voxelize the meshes and introduce novel strategies to detect grid cells that contain inconsistent mesh components. A robust algorithm is proposed to construct consistent local meshes to resolve mesh penetrations, and handle the coupling between explicit mesh and RLS surficial regions. We also provide further improvement on handling complicated topological variations, and strategies for remeshing mesh\/RLS interconversions.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864283","Keywords":"Surface tracking;explicit mesh;remeshing;regional level set;multi-material;spectrally refined grid"},"374":{"Title":"Orko: Facilitating Multimodal Interaction for Visual Exploration and Analysis of Networks","Authors":"A.

Our framework, called Persistence Atlas, enables the visualization of the dominant spatial patterns of critical points, along with statistics regarding their occurrence in the ensemble. The persistence atlas represents in the geometrical domain each dominant pattern in the form of a confidence map for the appearance of critical points. As a by-product, our method also provides 2-dimensional layouts of the entire ensemble, highlighting the main trends at a global level. Our approach is based on the new notion of Persistence Map, a measure of the geometrical density in critical points which leverages the robustness to noise of topological persistence to better emphasize salient features. We show how to leverage spectral embedding to represent the ensemble members as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, where distances between points measure the dissimilarities between critical point layouts and where statistical tasks, such as clustering, can be easily carried out. Further, we show how the notion of mandatory critical point can be leveraged to evaluate for each cluster confidence regions for the appearance of critical points. Most of the steps of this framework can be trivially parallelized and we show how to efficiently implement them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the relevance of our approach. The accuracy of the confidence regions provided by the persistence atlas is quantitatively evaluated and compared to a baseline strategy using an off-the-shelf clustering approach. We illustrate the importance of the persistence atlas in a variety of real-life datasets, where clear trends in feature layouts are identified and analyzed.

In this paper, we describe a novel method for vectorizing clipart images. In contrast to previous methods, we directly optimize the bezigons rather than using other intermediate representations; therefore, the resultant bezigons are not only of higher fidelity compared with the original raster image but also more reasonable because they were traced by a proficient expert. To enable such optimization, we have overcome several challenges and have devised a differentiable data energy as well as several curve-based prior terms. To improve the efficiency of the optimization, we also take advantage of the local control property of bezigons and adopt an overlapped piecewise optimization strategy.

Unfortunately, it is challenging to efficiently simulate these appealing effects in the framework of vortex filament methods. The vortex filaments in grids scheme allows to efficiently generate turbulent smoke with macroscopic vortical structures, but suffers from the projection-related dissipation, and thus the small-scale vortical structures under grid resolution are hard to capture. In addition, this scheme cannot be applied in wall-bounded turbulent smoke simulation, which requires efficiently handling smoke-obstacle interaction and creating vorticity at the obstacle boundary. To tackle above issues, we propose an effective filament-mesh particle-particle (FMPP) method for fast wall-bounded turbulent smoke simulation with ample details. The Filament-Mesh component approximates the smooth long-range interactions by splatting vortex filaments on grid, solving the Poisson problem with a fast solver, and then interpolating back to smoke particles. The Particle-Particle component introduces smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) turbulence model for particles in the same grid, where interactions between particles cannot be properly captured under grid resolution. Then, we sample the surface of obstacles with boundary particles, allowing the interaction between smoke and obstacle being treated as pressure forces in SPH. Besides, the vortex formation region is defined at the back of obstacles, providing smoke particles flowing by the separation particles with a vorticity force to simulate the subsequent vortex shedding phenomenon. The proposed approach can synthesize the lost small-scale vortical structures and also achieve the smoke-obstacle interaction with vortex shedding at obstacle boundaries in a lightweight manner. The experimental results demonstrate that our FMPP method can achieve more appealing visual effects than vortex filaments in grids scheme by efficiently simulating more vivid thin turbulent features.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2665551","Keywords":"Wall-bounded turbulent smoke;fluid-solid Interaction;vortex shedding"},"382":{"Title":"Is There a Robust Technique for Selecting Aspect Ratios in Line Charts?","Authors":"Y.

Different methods explore different criteria in choosing aspect ratios, but so far, it was still unclear how to select aspect ratios appropriately for any given data. This paper provides a guideline for the user to choose aspect ratios for any input 1D curves by conducting an in-depth analysis of aspect ratio selection methods both theoretically and experimentally. By formulating several existing methods as line integrals, we explain their parameterization invariance. Moreover, we derive a new and improved aspect ratio selection method, namely the $L_1$ -LOR (local orientation resolution), with a certain degree of parameterization invariance. Furthermore, we connect different methods, including AL (arc length based method), the banking to 45 $^\\circ$ principle, RV (resultant vector) and AS (average absolute slope), as well as  $L_1$ -LOR and AO (average absolute orientation). We verify these connections by a comparative evaluation involving various data sets, and show that the selections by RV and  $L_1$ -LOR are complementary to each other for most data. Accordingly, we propose the dual-scale banking technique that combines the strengths of RV and $L_1$ -LOR, and demonstrate its practicability using multiple real-world data sets.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2787113","Keywords":"Aspect ratio;parameterization invariance;line integral;banking to 45 $^\\circ$    ;orientation resolution"},"383":{"Title":"TopoAngler: Interactive Topology-Based Extraction of Fishes","Authors":"A.

The inherent noise in the CT scan coupled with the often disconnected (and sometimes broken) skeletal structure of fishes makes an automatic segmentation of the volume impractical. To overcome this, our framework combines techniques from computational topology with an interactive visual interface, enabling the human-in-the-Ioop to effectively extract fishes from the volume. In the first step, the join tree of the input is used to create a hierarchical segmentation of the volume. Through the use of linked views, the visual interface then allows users to interactively explore this hierarchy, and gather parts of individual fishes into a coherent sub-volume, thus reconstructing entire fishes. Our framework was primarily developed for its application to CT scans of fishes, generated as part of the ScanAllFish project, through close collaboration with their lead scientist. However, we expect it to also be applicable in other biological applications where a single dataset contains multiple specimen; a common routine that is now widely followed in laboratories to increase throughput of expensive CT scanners.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2743980","Keywords":"Computational topology;join trees;branch decomposition;hierarchical segmentation;interaction;visualization system"},"384":{"Title":"Surface Reconstruction via Fusing Sparse-Sequence of Depth Images","Authors":"L.

The existing methods scan a target by densely fusing all the captured depth images, yet most frames are redundant. The jittering frames inevitably embedded in handheld scanning process will cause feature blurring on the reconstructed model and even trigger the scan failure (i.e., camera tracking losing). To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel sparse-sequence fusion (SSF) algorithm for handheld scanning using commodity depth cameras. It first extracts related measurements for analyzing camera motion. Then based on these measurements, we progressively construct a supporting subset for the captured depth image sequence to decrease the data redundancy and the interference from jittering frames. Since SSF will reveal the intrinsic heavy noise of the original depth images, our method introduces a refinement process to eliminate the raw noise and recover geometric features for the depth images selected into the supporting subset. We finally obtain the fused result by integrating the refined depth images into the truncated signed distance field (TSDF) of the target. Multiple comparison experiments are conducted and the results verify the feasibility and validity of SSF for handheld scanning with a commodity depth camera.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2657766","Keywords":"Depth image refinement;handheld scanning;sparse-sequence fusion;surface reconstruction;supporting subset"},"385":{"Title":"An Intelligent System Approach for Probabilistic Volume Rendering Using Hierarchical 3D Convolutional Sparse Coding","Authors":"T.

The proposed approach automatically generates high-dimensional feature vectors in up to 75 dimensions, which are then fed into an intelligent system built on a random forest classifier for accurately classifying voxels from only a handful of selection scribbles made directly on the input data by the user. We apply the probabilistic transfer function to further customize and refine the rendered result. The proposed method is more intuitive to use and more robust to noise in comparison with conventional intensity-based classification methods.

Astrocytes are glial cells, i.e., non-neuronal cells that support neurons and the nervous system. The study of astrocytes has immense potential for understanding brain function. However, their complex and widely-branching structure requires high-resolution electron microscopy imaging and makes visualization and analysis challenging. Furthermore, the structure and function of astrocytes is very different from neurons, and therefore requires the development of new visualization and analysis tools. With Abstractocyte, biologists can explore the morphology of astrocytes using various visual abstraction levels, while simultaneously analyzing neighboring neurons and their connectivity. We define a novel, conceptual 2D abstraction space for jointly visualizing astrocytes and neurons. Neuroscientists can choose a specific joint visualization as a point in this space. Interactively moving this point allows them to smoothly transition between different abstraction levels in an intuitive manner. In contrast to simply switching between different visualizations, this preserves the visual context and correlations throughout the transition. Users can smoothly navigate from concrete, highly-detailed 3D views to simplified and abstracted 2D views. In addition to investigating astrocytes, neurons, and their relationships, we enable the interactive analysis of the distribution of glycogen, which is of high importance to neuroscientists. We describe the design of Abstractocyte, and present three case studies in which neuroscientists have successfully used our system to assess astrocytic coverage of synapses, glycogen distribution in relation to synapses, and astrocytic-mitochondria coverage.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744278","Keywords":"Connectomics;Neuroscience;Data Abstraction;Interactive 3D Visualization"},"387":{"Title":"Origin-Destination Flow Maps in Immersive Environments","Authors":"Y.

When displays are no longer intrinsically flat, how should we use the space around the user for abstract data visualisation? In this paper, we ask this question with respect to origin-destination flow data in a global geographic context. We report on the findings of three studies exploring different spatial encodings for flow maps. The first experiment focuses on different 2D and 3D encodings for flows on flat maps. We find that participants are significantly more accurate with raised flow paths whose height is proportional to flow distance but fastest with traditional straight line 2D flows. In our second and third experiment we compared flat maps, 3D globes and a novel interactive design we call MapsLink, involving a pair of linked flat maps. We find that participants took significantly more time with MapsLink than other flow maps while the 3D globe with raised flows was the fastest, most accurate, and most preferred method. Our work suggests that careful use of the third spatial dimension can resolve visual clutter in complex flow maps.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865192","Keywords":"Origin-destination;Flow Map;Virtual Reality;Cartographic Information Visualisation;Immersive Analytics"},"388":{"Title":"Fast and Scalable Position-Based Layout Synthesis","Authors":"T.

In this paper, we present a mining approach that automatically extracts meaningful features from a graph-based representation for exploring time-varying volumetric data.

We investigate the most important transition relationships for time-varying data and evaluate our solution with several time-varying data sets of different sizes and characteristics. For gaining insights from the data, we show that our solution is more efficient and effective than simply asking users to extract relationships via standard interaction techniques, especially when the data set is large and the relationships are complex.

This work presents a framework and end-to-end model for requirements engineering in problem-driven visualization application design. The framework and model are based on the activity-centered design paradigm, which is an enhancement of human-centered design. The proposed activity-centered approach focuses on user tasks and activities, and allows an explicit link between the requirements engineering process with the abstraction stage - and its evaluation - of existing, higher-level visualization design models. In a departure from existing visualization design models, the resulting model: assigns value to a visualization based on user activities; ranks user tasks before the user data; partitions requirements in activity-related capabilities and nonfunctional characteristics and constraints; and explicitly incorporates the user workflows into the requirements process. A further merit of this model is its explicit integration of functional specifications, a concept this work adapts from the software engineering literature, into the visualization design nested model. A quantitative evaluation using two sets of interdisciplinary projects supports the merits of the activity-centered model. The result is a practical roadmap to the domain characterization step of visualization design for problem-driven data visualization. Following this domain characterization model can help remove a number of pitfalls that have been identified multiple times in the visualization design literature.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744459","Keywords":"Design studies;Tasks and requirements analysis;Visualization models;Domain characterization;Activity-centered design;Functional specifications"},"394":{"Title":"Graph Drawing by Stochastic Gradient Descent","Authors":"J.

However, most prior studies focus on using low-level visual features of images, such as texture and color histogram, to create visualizations without considering the more important semantic information embedded in images. This paper proposes a novel visual analytic system to analyze images in a semantic-aware manner. The system mainly comprises two components: a semantic information extractor and a visual layout generator. The semantic information extractor employs an image captioning technique based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce descriptive captions for images, which can be transformed into semantic keywords. The layout generator employs a novel co-embedding model to project images and the associated semantic keywords to the same 2D space. Inspired by the galaxy metaphor, we further turn the projected 2D space to a galaxy visualization of images, in which semantic keywords and images are visually encoded as stars and planets. Our system naturally supports multi-scale visualization and navigation, in which users can immediately see a semantic overview of an image collection and drill down for detailed inspection of a certain group of images. Users can iteratively refine the visual layout by integrating their domain knowledge into the co-embedding process.

To apply pseudocoloring to a scalar field, the field value at each point is represented using one of a sequence of colors (called a colormap). One of the principles applied in generating colormaps is uniformity and previously the main method for determining uniformity has been the application of uniform color spaces. In this paper we present a new method for evaluating the feature detection threshold function across a colormap. The method is used in crowdsourced studies for the direct evaluation of nine colormaps for three feature sizes. The results are used to test the hypothesis that a uniform color space (CIELAB) will accurately model colormapped feature detection thresholds compared to a model where the chromaticity components have reduced weights. The hypothesis that feature detection can be predicted solely on the basis of luminance is also tested. The results reject both hypotheses and we demonstrate how reduced weights on the green-red and blue-yellow terms of the CIELAB color space creates a more accurate model when the task is the detection of smaller features in colormapped data. Both the method itself and modified CIELAB can be used in colormap design and evaluation.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2855742","Keywords":"Colormapping;color perception"},"398":{"Title":"AR Feels \u201cSofter\u201d than VR: Haptic Perception of Stiffness in Augmented versus Virtual Reality","Authors":"Y.

We have designed an experimental setup based on a Microsoft HoloLens and a haptic force-feedback device, enabling to press a virtual piston, and compare its stiffness successively in either Augmented Reality (the virtual piston is surrounded by several real objects all located inside a cardboard box) or in Virtual Reality (the same virtual piston is displayed in a fully virtual scene composed of the same other objects).

Our method proposes an egocentric normalization of the body-part relative distances to preserve the consistency of self contacts for a large variety of human-like target characters. Egocentric coordinates are character independent and encode the whole posture space, i.e., it ensures the continuity of the motion with and without self-contacts. We can transfer classes of complex postures involving multiple interacting limb segments by preserving their spatial order without depending on temporal coherence. The mapping process exploits a low-cost constraint relaxation technique relying on analytic inverse kinematics; thus, we can achieve online performance animation.

In this work, we investigated how user behaviour is affected when the Virtual Environment differs from the physical space. We created two sets of four environments each, plus a virtual replica of the physical environment as a baseline. The first focused on aesthetic discrepancies, such as a water surface in place of solid ground. The second focused on mixing immaterial objects together with those paired to tangible objects. For example, barring an area with walls or obstacles. We designed a study where participants had to reach three waypoints laid out in such a way to prompt a decision on which path to follow based on the conflict between the mismatching visual stimuli and their awareness of the real layout of the room. We analysed their performances to determine whether their trajectories were altered significantly from the shortest route. Our results indicate that participants altered their trajectories in presence of surfaces representing higher walking difficulty (for example, water instead of grass). However, when the graphical appearance was found to be ambiguous, there was no significant trajectory alteration. The environments mixing immaterial with physical objects had the most impact on trajectories with a mean deviation from the shortest route of 60 cm against the 37 cm of environments with aesthetic alterations. The co-existance of paired and unpaired virtual objects was reported to support the idea that all objects participants saw were backed by physical props. From these results and our observations, we derive guidelines on how to alter user movement behaviour in Virtual Environments.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2657038","Keywords":"Virtual reality;Locomotion;User behaviour"},"401":{"Title":"Semantic Entity-Component State Management Techniques to Enhance Software Quality for Multimodal VR-Systems","Authors":"M.

Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR) systems, modern computer games, as well as interactive human-robot systems often include various dedicated input-, output-, and processing subsystems. These subsystems collectively maintain a real-time simulation of a coherent application state. The resulting interdependencies between individual state representations, mutual state access, overall synchronization, and flow of control implies a conceptual close coupling whereas software quality asks for a decoupling to develop maintainable solutions. This article presents five semantics-based software techniques that address this contradiction: Semantic grounding, code from semantics, grounded actions, semantic queries, and decoupling by semantics. These techniques are applied to extend the well-established entity-component-system (ECS) pattern to overcome some of this pattern's deficits with respect to the implied state access. A walk-through of central implementation aspects of a multimodal (speech and gesture) VR-interface is used to highlight the techniques' benefits. This use-case is chosen as a prototypical example of complex architectures with multiple interacting subsystems found in many VR, AR and MR architectures.

Finding abnormal patterns in such data poses significant challenges. Given that there is often no clear boundary between normal and abnormal patterns, existing solutions are limited in their capacity of identifying anomalies in large, dynamic and heterogeneous data, interpreting anomalies in their multifaceted, spatiotemporal context, and allowing users to provide feedback in the analysis loop. In this work, we introduce a unified visual interactive system and framework, Voila, for interactively detecting anomalies in spatiotemporal data collected from a streaming data source. The system is designed to meet two requirements in real-world applications, i.e., online monitoring and interactivity. We propose a novel tensor-based anomaly analysis algorithm with visualization and interaction design that dynamically produces contextualized, interpretable data summaries and allows for interactively ranking anomalous patterns based on user input. Using the \u201csmart city\u201d as an example scenario, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through quantitative evaluation and qualitative case studies.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744419","Keywords":"Anomaly Detection;Visual Analysis"},"406":{"Title":"Multiple Coordinated Views at Large Displays for Multiple Users: Empirical Findings on User Behavior, Movements, and Distances","Authors":"R. Langner; U. Kister; R. Dachselt","Abstract":"Interactive wall-sized displays benefit data visualization. Due to their sheer display size, they make it possible to show large amounts of data in multiple coordinated views (MCV) and facilitate collaborative data analysis. In this work, we propose a set of important design considerations and contribute a fundamental input vocabulary and interaction mapping for MCV functionality. We also developed a fully functional application with more than 45 coordinated views visualizing a real-world, multivariate data set of crime activities, which we used in a comprehensive qualitative user study investigating how pairs of users behave. Most importantly, we found that flexible movement is essential and-depending on user goals-is connected to collaboration, perception, and interaction. Therefore, we argue that for future systems interaction from the distance is required and needs good support. We show that our consistent design for both direct touch at the large display and distant interaction using mobile phones enables the seamless exploration of large-scale MCV at wall-sized displays. Our MCV application builds on design aspects such as simplicity, flexibility, and visual consistency and, therefore, supports realistic workflows. We believe that in the future, many visual data analysis scenarios will benefit from wall-sized displays presenting numerous coordinated visualizations, for which our findings provide a valuable foundation.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865235","Keywords":"Multiple coordinated views;wall-sized displays;mobile devices;distant interaction;physical navigation;user behavior;user movements;multi-user;collaborative data analysis"},"407":{"Title":"Natural Environment Illumination: Coherent Interactive Augmented Reality for Mobile and Non-Mobile Devices","Authors":"K.

However, in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as well as in other domains, there are many situations where such a spatial overview is not relevant or practical for users, for example when the experts already have a good mental overview of the data, or when an analysis of a large overall structure may not be related to the specific, information-driven tasks of users. Using scientific workflow theory and, as a vehicle, the problem of viscous finger evolution, we advocate an alternative model that allows domain experts to explore features of interest first, then explore the context around those features, and finally move to a potentially unfamiliar summarization overview. In a model instantiation, we show how a computational back-end can identify and track over time low-level, small features, then be used to filter the context of those features while controlling the complexity of the visualization, and finally to summarize and compare simulations.

This yields a probabilistic mixture model for the streamline distribution, from which confidence regions can be derived in which the streamlines are most likely to reside. This is achieved by transforming the Gaussian random distributions from the low-dimensional Euclidean space into a streamline distribution that follows the statistical model, and by visualizing confidence regions in this distribution via iso-contours. We further make use of the principal component representation to introduce a new concept of streamline-median, based on existing median concepts in multidimensional Euclidean spaces.

McGuire","Abstract":"We further describe and analyze the idea of hashed alpha testing from Wyman and McGuire\u00a0[1] , which builds on stochastic alpha testing and simplifies stochastic transparency. Typically, alpha testing provides a simple mechanism to mask out complex silhouettes using simple proxy geometry with applied alpha textures. While widely used, alpha testing has a long-standing problem: geometry can disappear entirely as alpha mapped polygons recede with distance. As foveated rendering for virtual reality spreads, this problem worsens as peripheral minification and prefiltering introduce this problem on nearby objects. We first introduce the notion of stochastic alpha testing, which replaces a fixed alpha threshold of $\\alpha _\\tau =0.5$ with a randomly chosen $\\alpha _\\tau \\in [0..1)$. This entirely avoids the problem of disappearing alpha-tested geometry, but introduces temporal noise. Hashed alpha testing uses a hash function to choose $\\alpha _\\tau$ procedurally. With a good hash function and inputs, hashed alpha testing maintains distant geometry without introducing more temporal flicker than traditional alpha testing. We also describe how hashed alpha interacts with temporal antialiasing and applies to alpha-to-coverage and screen-door transparency. Because hashed alpha testing addresses alpha test aliasing by introducing stable sampling, it has implications in other domains where increased sample stability is desirable. We show how our hashed sampling might apply to other stochastic effects.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2739149","Keywords":"Anisotropy;alpha map;alpha test;hash;hashed alpha test;stable shading;stochastic sampling"},"413":{"Title":"ASCII Art Synthesis from Natural Photographs","Authors":"X.

The major challenge lies on extracting the perception-sensitive structure from the natural photographs so that a more concise ASCII art reproduction can be produced based on the structure. However, due to excessive amount of texture in natural photos, extracting perception-sensitive structure is not easy, especially when the structure may be weak and within the texture region. Besides, to fit different target text resolutions, the amount of the extracted structure should also be controllable. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a visual perception mechanism of non-classical receptive field modulation (non-CRF modulation) from physiological findings to this ASCII art application, and propose a new model of non-CRF modulation which can better separate the weak structure from the crowded texture, and also better control the scale of texture suppression. Thanks to our non-CRF model, more sensible ASCII art reproduction can be obtained. In addition, to produce more visually appealing ASCII arts, we propose a novel optimization scheme to obtain the optimal placement of proportional-font characters. We apply our method on a rich variety of images, and visually appealing ASCII art can be obtained in all cases.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2569084","Keywords":"ASCII art synthesis;non-classical receptive field modulation;texture suppression"},"414":{"Title":"Geometric and Photometric Consistency in a Mixed Video and Galvanoscopic Scanning Laser Projection Mapping System","Authors":"P.

This method allows for accurate merging of 3D vertex data displayed on the laser projector with geometrically calibrated standard rasterization-based video projectors that are registered to the same geometry. Because laser projectors send out a laser light beam via galvanoscopic mirrors, a standard pinhole model calibration procedure that is normally used for pixel raster displays projecting structured light patterns, such as Gray codes, cannot be carried out directly with sufficient accuracy as the rays do not converge into a single point. To overcome the complications of accurately registering the GLP while still enabling a treatment equivalent to a standard pinhole device, an adapted version is applied to enable straightforward content generation. Besides the geometrical calibration, we also present a photometric calibration to unify the color appearance of GLPs and standard video projectors maximizing the advantages of the large color gamut of the GLP and optimizing its color appearance to smoothly fade into the significantly smaller gamut of the video projector.

Wang; J. Wu; X. Yang; V. Popescu","Abstract":"Virtual Reality (VR) applications allow a user to explore a scene intuitively through a tracked head-mounted display (HMD). However, in complex scenes, occlusions make scene exploration inefficient, as the user has to navigate around occluders to gain line of sight to potential regions of interest. When a scene region proves to be of no interest, the user has to retrace their path, and such a sequential scene exploration implies significant amounts of wasted navigation. Furthermore, as the virtual world is typically much larger than the tracked physical space hosting the VR application, the intuitive one-to-one mapping between the virtual and real space has to be temporarily suspended for the user to teleport or redirect in order to conform to the physical space constraints. In this paper we introduce a method for improving VR exploration efficiency by automatically constructing a multiperspective visualization that removes occlusions. For each frame, the scene is first rendered conventionally, the z-buffer is analyzed to detect horizontal and vertical depth discontinuities, the discontinuities are used to define disocclusion portals which are 3D scene rectangles for routing rays around occluders, and the disocclusion portals are used to render a multiperpsective image that alleviates occlusions. The user controls the multiperspective disocclusion effect, deploying and retracting it with small head translations. We have quantified the VR exploration efficiency brought by our occlusion removal method in a study where participants searched for a stationary target, and chased a dynamic target. Our method showed an advantage over conventional VR exploration in terms of reducing the navigation distance, the view direction rotation, the number of redirections, and the task completion time. These advantages did not come at the cost of a reduction in depth perception or situational awareness, or of an increase in simulator sickness.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2019.2898782","Keywords":"VR exploration;occlusion removal;disocclusion portal;multiperspective visualization"},"416":{"Title":"Virtual Character Animation Based on Affordable Motion Capture and Reconfigurable Tangible Interfaces","Authors":"F.

However, despite their widespread application, little is known about the structure and properties of these spaces. To gain insights into the relationship between words, the NLP community has begun to adapt high-dimensional visualization techniques. In particular, researchers commonly use t-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddings (t-SNE) and principal component analysis (PCA) to create two-dimensional embeddings for assessing the overall structure and exploring linear relationships (e.g., word analogies), respectively. Unfortunately, these techniques often produce mediocre or even misleading results and cannot address domain-specific visualization challenges that are crucial for understanding semantic relationships in word embeddings. Here, we introduce new embedding techniques for visualizing semantic and syntactic analogies, and the corresponding tests to determine whether the resulting views capture salient structures. Additionally, we introduce two novel views for a comprehensive study of analogy relationships. Finally, we augment t-SNE embeddings to convey uncertainty information in order to allow a reliable interpretation. Combined, the different views address a number of domain-specific tasks difficult to solve with existing tools.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2745141","Keywords":"Natural Language Processing;Word Embedding;High-Dimensional Data"},"418":{"Title":"EventThread: Visual Summarization and Stage Analysis of Event Sequence Data","Authors":"S.

Analyzing collections of event sequences can reveal common or semantically important sequential patterns. For example, event sequence analysis might reveal frequently used care plans for treating a disease, typical publishing patterns of professors, and the patterns of service that result in a well-maintained car. It is challenging, however, to visually explore large numbers of event sequences, or sequences with large numbers of event types. Existing methods focus on extracting explicitly matching patterns of events using statistical analysis to create stages of event progression over time. However, these methods fail to capture latent clusters of similar but not identical evolutions of event sequences. In this paper, we introduce a novel visualization system named EventThread which clusters event sequences into threads based on tensor analysis and visualizes the latent stage categories and evolution patterns by interactively grouping the threads by similarity into time-specific clusters.

Given a manifold surface and an$N$-way rotational symmetry field, a branched covering space is a manifold surface that has an$N$-to-1 map to the original surface except at theramification points, which correspond to the singularities in the rotational symmetry field. Understanding the notion and mathematical properties of branched covering spaces is important to researchers in tensor field visualization and geometry processing, and their application areas. In this paper, we provide a framework to interactively design and visualize the branched covering space (BCS) of an input mesh surface and a rotational symmetry field defined on it. In our framework, the user can visualize not only the BCSs but also their construction process. In addition, our system allows the user to design the geometric realization of the BCS using mesh deformation techniques as well as connecting tubes. This enables the user to verify important facts about BCSs such as that they are manifold surfaces around singularities, as well as theRiemann-Hurwitz formulawhich relates the Euler characteristic of the BCS to that of the original mesh.

Intrinsic body shape is first precomputed for a given subject, by determining shape parameters with the aid of a body shape database. Subsequently, per-frame pose parameter estimation is performed by means of linear blending skinning (LBS); the problem is decomposed into separately finding skinning weights and transformations. The skinning weights are also determined offline from the body shape database,reducing online reconstruction to simply finding the transformations in LBS. Doing so is formulated as a linear variational problem;carefully designed constraints are used to impose temporal coherence and alleviate artifacts.

Here, Shifty was shown to increase the user's fun and perceived realism significantly, compared to an equivalent passive haptic proxy. In a second experiment, Shifty is used to pick up virtual objects of different virtual weights. The results show that Shifty enhances the perception of weight and thus the perceived realism by adapting its kinesthetic feedback to the picked-up virtual object.

The regularization comprises two iterative stages: (1) the linear features are semi-automatically proposed from images by exploiting photometric and geometric clues jointly; (2) the scaffold topology represented by spatial relations among the linear features is optimized according to data fidelity and topological rules, then the mesh is refined by adjusting itself to the consolidated scaffold. Our method has two advantages. First, the proposed scaffold representation is able to concisely describe semantic building structures. Second, the scaffold structure is embedded in the mesh, which can preserve the mesh connectivity and avoid stitching or intersecting surfaces in challenging cases. We demonstrate that our method can enhance structural characteristics and suppress irregularities in the building models robustly in some challenging datasets. Moreover, the regularization can significantly improve the results of general applications such as simplification and non-photorealistic rendering.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2461163","Keywords":"Modeling packages;Reconstruction.;Modeling packages;reconstruction"},"429":{"Title":"Keeping Multiple Views Consistent: Constraints, Validations, and Exceptions in Visualization Authoring","Authors":"Z. Qu; J. Hullman","Abstract":"Visualizations often appear in multiples, either in a single display (e.g., small multiples, dashboard) or across time or space (e.g., slideshow, set of dashboards). However, existing visualization design guidelines typically focus on single rather than multiple views. Solely following these guidelines can lead to effective yet inconsistent views (e.g., the same field has different axes domains across charts), making interpretation slow and error-prone. Moreover, little is known how consistency balances with other design considerations, making it difficult to incorporate consistency mechanisms in visualization authoring software. We present a wizard-of-oz study in which we observed how Tableau users achieve and sacrifice consistency in an exploration-to-presentation visualization design scenario. We extend (from our prior work) a set of encoding-specific constraints defining consistency across multiple views. Using the constraints as a checklist in our study, we observed cases where participants spontaneously maintained consistent encodings and warned cases where consistency was overlooked. In response to the warnings, participants either revised views for consistency or stated why they thought consistency should be overwritten. We categorize participants' actions and responses as constraint validations and exceptions, depicting the relative importance of consistency and other design considerations under various circumstances (e.g., data cardinality, available encoding resources, chart layout). We discuss automatic consistency checking as a constraint-satisfaction problem and provide design implications for communicating inconsistencies to users.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744198","Keywords":"Visualization Design;Qualitative Study;Evaluation"},"430":{"Title":"Advanced Hierarchical Spherical Parameterizations","Authors":"X.

Existing methods usually suffer from a lack of practical robustness or poor quality. In this paper, we present a practically robust method to compute high-quality spherical parameterizations with bijection and low isometric distortion. Our method is based on the hierarchical scheme containing mesh decimation and parameterization refinement. The practical robustness of our method relies on two novel techniques. The first one is a flat-to-extrusive decimation strategy, which contains two decimation error metrics to alleviate the difficulty of further mesh refinement. The second is a flexible group refinement technique that consists of flexible vertex insertion and efficient volumetric distortion minimization to control the maximum distortion. We convert the task of volumetric distortion minimization to one of tetrahedral mesh improvement to make the vertices distribute uniformly for efficient refinement. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method is more practically robust and possesses better mapping qualities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in spherical parameterization computations on a data set containing over five thousand complex models.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2704119","Keywords":"Spherical parameterizations;bijection;low isometric distortion;flat-to-extrusive decimation;volumetric distortion optimization;bijective surface correspondence"},"431":{"Title":"Transformation of the Multivariate Generalized Gaussian Distribution for Image Editing","Authors":"H.

We focus on integer label data, whose efficient representation in memory, as well as fast random data access, pose an even greater challenge than the raw image data. Often, it is crucial to be able to rapidly identify which segments are located where, whether for empty space skipping for fast rendering, or for spatial proximity queries. We refer to this process as culling. In order to enable efficient culling of millions of labeled segments, we present a novel hybrid approach that combines deterministic and probabilistic representations of label data in a data-adaptive hierarchical data structure that we call the label list tree. In each node, we adaptively encode label data using either a probabilistic constant-time access representation for fast conservative culling, or a deterministic logarithmic-time access representation for exact queries. We choose the best data structures for representing the labels of each spatial region while building the label list tree. At run time, we further employ a novel query-adaptive culling strategy. While filtering a query down the tree, we prune it successively, and in each node adaptively select the representation that is best suited for evaluating the pruned query, depending on its size. We show an analysis of the efficiency of our approach with several large data sets from connectomics, including a brain scan with more than 13 million labeled segments, and compare our method to conventional culling approaches. Our approach achieves significant reductions in storage size as well as faster query times.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864847","Keywords":"Hierarchical Culling;Segmented Volume Data;Bloom Filter;Volume Rendering;Spatial Queries"},"434":{"Title":"InkPlanner: Supporting Prewriting via Intelligent Visual Diagramming","Authors":"Z.

Based on the learners' needs and experts' recommendations, we then designed and developed InkPlanner, a novel pen and touch visualization tool that allows writers to utilize visual diagramming for ideation during prewriting. InkPlanner further allows writers to sort their ideas into a logical and sequential narrative by using a novel widget- NarrativeLine. Using a NarrativeLine, InkPlanner can automatically generate a document outline to guide later drafting exercises. Inkplanner is powered by machine-generated semantic and structural suggestions that are curated from various texts. To qualitatively review the tool and understand how writers use InkPlanner for prewriting, two writing experts were interviewed and a user study was conducted with university students.

In this display, usually positioned close to the observer, a region of the background scene is shown, yielding the sensation that the display is transparent. To achieve the transparency effect, it is very important to compensate the parallax error and other distortions caused by the image acquisition system. In this paper a detailed study of a video see-through methodology with parallax correction is performed. In a system composed by two cameras-one directed to the user and another to the background scene-and a display, the relative position between the user, the display and the scene is estimated using a feature detection algorithm and the parallax error is compensated assuming a planar scene model. The application of the proposed methodology on Driver Assistance Systems (DAS) is proposed. A theoretical assessment of the algorithm shows that although approximations are proposed to simplify the methodology and reduce the computational cost, such as the planar scene model and fixed working distance, on some practical situations their effects can be neglected without noticeable impact on the perceptual quality of the solution.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2705184","Keywords":"See-through;virtual transparency;DAS;parallax;augmented reality;user-perspective rendering;dual-view"},"436":{"Title":"Interactive obstruction-free lensing for volumetric data visualization","Authors":"M.

While many techniques such as transfer functions, volume segmentation or view distortion have been developed to address this, there is still room for improvement to better support the understanding of objects' vicinity. However, most existing Focus+Context fail to solve partial occlusion in datasets where the target and the occluder are very similar density-wise. For these reasons, we investigate a new technique which maintains the general structure of the investigated volumetric dataset while addressing occlusion issues. With our technique, the user interactively defines an area of interest where an occluded region or object is partially visible. Then our lens starts pushing at its border occluding objects, thus revealing hidden volumetric data. Next, the lens is modified with an extended field of view (fish-eye deformation) to better see the vicinity of the selected region. Finally, the user can freely explore the surroundings of the area under investigation within the lens. To provide real-time exploration, we implemented our lens using a GPU accelerated ray-casting framework to handle ray deformations, local lighting, and local viewpoint manipulation. We illustrate our technique with five application scenarios in baggage inspection, 3D fluid flow visualization, chest radiology, air traffic planning, and DTI fiber exploration.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864690","Keywords":"Interaction techniques;focus + context;volume visualization;volume rendering;raycasting"},"437":{"Title":"A Linguistic Approach to Categorical Color Assignment for Data Visualization","Authors":"V.

To do this effectively, we need first to establish that a term has a strong semantic color association, then discover which color or colors express it. Using co-occurrence measures of color name frequencies from Google n-grams, we define a measure for colorability that describes how strongly associated a given term is to any of a set of basic color terms. We then show how this colorability score can be used with additional semantic analysis to rank and retrieve a representative color from Google Images. Alternatively, we use symbolic relationships defined by WordNet to select identity colors for categories such as countries or brands. To create visually distinct color palettes, we use k-means clustering to create visually distinct sets, iteratively reassigning terms with multiple basic color associations as needed. This can be additionally constrained to use colors only in a predefined palette.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467471","Keywords":"linguistics;natural language processing;semantics;color names;categorical color;Google n-grams;WordNet;XKCD;Linguistics;natural language processing;semantics;color names;categorical color;Google n-grams;WordNet;XKCD"},"438":{"Title":"TimeSpan: Using Visualization to Explore Temporal Multi-dimensional Data of Stroke Patients","Authors":"M.

Working with stroke experts, we seek to provide a tool to help improve outcomes for stroke victims. Time is of critical importance in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients. Every minute that the artery stays blocked, an estimated 1.9 million neurons and 12 km of myelinated axons are destroyed. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficiency of stroke treatment processes. Optimizing time to treatment requires a deep understanding of interval times. Stroke health care professionals must analyze the impact of procedures, events, and patient attributes on time-ultimately, to save lives and improve quality of life after stroke. First, we interviewed eight domain experts, and closely collaborated with two of them to inform the design of TimeSpan. We classify the analytical tasks which a visualization tool should support and extract design goals from the interviews and field observations. Based on these tasks and the understanding gained from the collaboration, we designed TimeSpan, a web-based tool for exploring multi-dimensional and temporal stroke data. We describe how TimeSpan incorporates factors from stacked bar graphs, line charts, histograms, and a matrix visualization to create an interactive hybrid view of temporal data. From feedback collected from domain experts in a focus group session, we reflect on the lessons we learned from abstracting the tasks and iteratively designing TimeSpan.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467325","Keywords":"Multi-dimensional data,;Temporal event sequences;Electronic health records;Multi-dimensional data;Temporal event sequences;Electronic health records"},"439":{"Title":"Divergence-Free SPH for Incompressible and Viscous Fluids","Authors":"J.

The most efficient SPH-based approaches enforce incompressibility either on position or velocity level. However, the continuity equation for incompressible flow demands to maintain a constant density and a divergence-free velocity field. We propose a combination of two novel implicit pressure solvers enforcing both a low volume compression as well as a divergence-free velocity field. While a compression-free fluid is essential for realistic physical behavior, a divergence-free velocity field drastically reduces the number of required solver iterations and increases the stability of the simulation significantly. Thanks to the improved stability, our method can handle larger time steps than previous approaches. This results in a substantial performance gain since the computationally expensive neighborhood search has to be performed less frequently. Moreover, we introduce a third optional implicit solver to simulate highly viscous fluids which seamlessly integrates into our solver framework. Our implicit viscosity solver produces realistic results while introducing almost no numerical damping. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness and scalability of our method in a variety of complex simulations including scenarios with millions of turbulent particles or highly viscous materials.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2578335","Keywords":"Fluid simulation;smoothed particle hydrodynamics;divergence-free fluids;incompressibility;viscous fluids;implicit integration"},"440":{"Title":"Pose-Inspired Shape Synthesis and Functional Hybrid","Authors":"Q.

Users may control the design process by manipulating the input pose, or optionally specifying one or more desired categories. We also extend our approach to be used by a single operator with multiple poses or by multiple human operators.

However, na\u00efve display of the content on the side walls results in the appearance of distorted images according to the location of the viewer.

Automated methods can be useful to some extent but bringing the data analyst into the loop via interactive visual tools can help the discovery process tremendously. An inherent problem in this effort is that humans lack the mental capacity to truly understand spaces exceeding three spatial dimensions. To keep within this limitation, we describe a framework that decomposes a high-dimensional data space into a continuum of generalized 3D subspaces. Analysts can then explore these 3D subspaces individually via the familiar trackball interface while using additional facilities to smoothly transition to adjacent subspaces for expanded space comprehension. Since the number of such subspaces suffers from combinatorial explosion, we provide a set of data-driven subspace selection and navigation tools which can guide users to interesting subspaces and views. A subspace trail map allows users to manage the explored subspaces, keep their bearings, and return to interesting subspaces and views. Both trackball and trail map are each embedded into a word cloud of attribute labels which aid in navigation.

Xu; M. Xia; X. Mu; Y. Wang; N. Cao","Abstract":"The results of anomaly detection are sensitive to the choice of detection algorithms as they are specialized for different properties of data, especially for multidimensional data. Thus, it is vital to select the algorithm appropriately. To systematically select the algorithms, ensemble analysis techniques have been developed to support the assembly and comparison of heterogeneous algorithms. However, challenges remain due to the absence of the ground truth, interpretation, or evaluation of these anomaly detectors. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system named EnsembleLens that evaluates anomaly detection algorithms based on the ensemble analysis process. The system visualizes the ensemble processes and results by a set of novel visual designs and multiple coordinated contextual views to meet the requirements of correlation analysis, assessment and reasoning of anomaly detection algorithms. We also introduce an interactive analysis workflow that dynamically produces contextualized and interpretable data summaries that allow further refinements of exploration results based on user feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EnsembleLens through a quantitative evaluation, three case studies with real-world data and interviews with two domain experts.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864825","Keywords":"Algorithm Evaluation;Ensemble Analysis;Anomaly Detection;Visual Analysis;Multidimensional Data"},"454":{"Title":"Applying Pragmatics Principles for Interaction with Visual Analytics","Authors":"E.

The goal of those techniques is to enable users to explore events and interactions over space and time in order to facilitate the discovery of patterns, anomalies and relationships within the data. However, it is difficult to extract and visualize data flow patterns over time for non-directional statistical data without trajectory information. In this work, we develop a novel flow analysis technique to extract, represent, and analyze flow maps of non-directional spatiotemporal data unaccompanied by trajectory information. We estimate a continuous distribution of these events over space and time, and extract flow fields for spatial and temporal changes utilizing a gravity model. Then, we visualize the spatiotemporal patterns in the data by employing flow visualization techniques. The user is presented with temporal trends of geo-referenced discrete events on a map. As such, overall spatiotemporal data flow patterns help users analyze geo-referenced temporal events, such as disease outbreaks, crime patterns, etc. To validate our model, we discard the trajectory information in an origin-destination dataset and apply our technique to the data and compare the derived trajectories and the original. Finally, we present spatiotemporal trend analysis for statistical datasets including twitter data, maritime search and rescue events, and syndromic surveillance.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2666146","Keywords":"Spatiotemporal data visualization;kernel density estimation;flow map;gravity model"},"457":{"Title":"Graphicle: Exploring Units, Networks, and Context in a Blended Visualization Approach","Authors":"T.

However, ineffective meeting summaries can impair this process, especially when participants have difficulty remembering what was said and what its context was. To assist with this process, we introduce MeetingVis, a visual narrative-based approach to meeting summarization. MeetingVis is composed of two primary components: (1) a data pipeline that processes the spoken audio from a group discussion, and (2) a visual-based interface that efficiently displays the summarized content. To design MeetingVis, we create a taxonomy of relevant meeting data points, identifying salient elements to promote recall and reflection. These are mapped to an augmented storyline visualization, which combines the display of participant activities, topic evolutions, and task assignments. For evaluation, we conduct a qualitative user study with five groups. Feedback from the study indicates that MeetingVis effectively triggers the recall of subtle details from prior meetings: all study participants were able to remember new details, points, and tasks compared to an unaided, memory-only baseline.

Clinical work flows and research based on pathology have, until now, largely been dominated by 2D imaging.

Our starting point is the current lack of appropriate visualization tools in histopathology, which has been a limiting factor in the uptake of digital pathology. Visualization of 3D histology data does pose difficult challenges in several aspects. The full-color datasets are dense and large in scale, on the order of 100,000 \u00d7 100,000 \u00d7 100 voxels. This entails serious demands on both rendering performance and user experience design.

Rather than relying on timestamped rays and Monte Carlo sampling to resolve the motion blur, we associate a time interval with rays and directly evaluate when and where each ray intersects with animated object faces. Based on our simplifications, the volume swept by each animated face is represented using a triangulation of the surface of this volume. Thus, we can resolve motion blur through ray intersections with stationary triangles, and we can use any standard ray tracing acceleration structure without modifications to account for the time dimension. Rays are intersected with these triangles to analytically determine the time interval and positions of the intersections with the moving objects. Furthermore, we explain an adaptive strategy to efficiently shade the intersection intervals. As a result, we can produce noise-free motion blur for both primary and secondary rays. We also provide a general framework for emulating various camera shutter mechanisms and an artistic modification that amplifies the visibility of moving objects for emphasizing the motion in videos or static images.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2775241","Keywords":"Motion blur;ray tracing;sampling"},"462":{"Title":"The Discriminative Power of Shape an Empirical Study in Time Series Matching","Authors":"K.

The well established dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and its variants do this matching by determining a non-linear time mapping to minimise euclidean distances between corresponding time-warped points. However the shape of curves is not considered. In this paper, we present a new shape-aware algorithm which uses time and shape correspondence (TSC) at increasing levels of detail to define a similarity measure with an L0 norm to aggregate the results, making it robust to noise and missing data. The L0 norm is implicitly regularised using a shape-based error. Through extensive experiments we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms existing state of the art algorithms, works more effectively with high dimensional data, and handles noise and missing data better.

Fukiage; T. Kawabe; S.

It produces illusory motion impressions in the projection target by projecting gray-scale motion-inducer patterns that selectively drive the motion detectors in the human visual system. Since a compelling illusory motion can be produced by an inducer pattern weaker than necessary to perfectly reproduce the shift of the original pattern on an object's surface, the technique works well under bright environmental light conditions. However, determining the best deformation sizes is often difficult: When users try to add a large deformation, the deviation in the projected patterns from the original surface pattern on the target object becomes apparent. Therefore, to obtain satisfactory results, they have to spend much time and effort to manually adjust the shift sizes. Here, to overcome this limitation, we propose an optimization framework that adaptively retargets the displacement vectors based on a perceptual model. The perceptual model predicts the subjective inconsistency between a projected pattern and an original one by simulating responses in the human visual system. The displacement vectors are adaptively optimized so that the projection effect is maximized within the tolerable range predicted by the model. We extensively evaluated the perceptual model and optimization method through a psychophysical experiment as well as user studies.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2019.2898738","Keywords":"Spatial augmented reality;human visual system;perceptual model"},"464":{"Title":"DrawFromDrawings: 2D Drawing Assistance via Stroke Interpolation with a Sketch Database","Authors":"Y.

In art, it may further be used to express a certain mood or emphasize objects. Here, artists often rely on stylization when creating scattering effects, not only because of the complexity of physically correct scattering, but also to increase expressiveness. Little research, however, focuses on artistically influencing the simulation of the scattering process in a virtual 3D scene. We propose novel stylization techniques, enabling artists to change the appearance of single scattering effects such as light shafts. Users can add, remove, or enhance light shafts using occluder manipulation. The colors of the light shafts can be stylized and animated using easily modifiable transfer functions. Alternatively, our system can optimize a light map given a simple user input for a number of desired views in the 3D world. Finally, we enable artists to control the heterogeneity of the underlying medium. Our stylized scattering solution is easy to use and compatible with standard rendering pipelines.

According to the analysis focus, the analyst may need to cluster trajectories by similarity of their relevant parts only. Throughout the analysis process, the focus may change, and different parts of trajectories may become relevant. We propose an analytical workflow in which interactive filtering tools are used to attach relevance flags to elements of trajectories, clustering is done using a distance function that ignores irrelevant elements, and the resulting clusters are summarized for further analysis.

It exploits information from connected eye-trackers embedded in the next generation of VR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). The proposed solution aims to deliver high visual quality, in real time, around the users' fixations points while lowering the quality everywhere else. The goal of the proposed approach is to substantially reduce the overall bandwidth requirements for supporting VR video experiences while delivering high levels of user perceived quality. The prerequisites to achieve these results are: (1) mechanisms that can cope with different degrees of latency in the system and (2) solutions that support fast adaptation of video quality in different parts of a frame, without requiring a large increase in bitrate. A novel codec configuration, capable of supporting near-instantaneous video quality adaptation in specific portions of a video frame, is presented. The proposed method exploits in-built properties of HEVC encoders and while it introduces a moderate amount of error, these errors are indetectable by users. Fast adaptation is the key to enable gaze-aware streaming and its reduction in bandwidth. A testbed implementing gaze-aware streaming, together with a prototype HMD with in-built eye tracker, is presented and was used for testing with real users. The studies quantified the bandwidth savings achievable by the proposed approach and characterize the relationships between Quality of Experience (QoE) and network latency.

A nonlinear narrative is a storytelling device that portrays events of a story out of chronological order, e.g., in reverse order or going back and forth between past and future events. Many acclaimed movies employ unique narrative patterns which in turn have inspired other movies and contributed to the broader analysis of narrative patterns in movies. However, understanding and communicating nonlinear narratives is a difficult task due to complex temporal disruptions in the order of events as well as no explicit records specifying the actual temporal order of the underlying story. Story curves visualize the nonlinear narrative of a movie by showing the order in which events are told in the movie and comparing them to their actual chronological order, resulting in possibly meandering visual patterns in the curve. We also present Story Explorer, an interactive tool that visualizes a story curve together with complementary information such as characters and settings. Story Explorer further provides a script curation interface that allows users to specify the chronological order of events in movies. We used Story Explorer to analyze 10 popular nonlinear movies and describe the spectrum of narrative patterns that we discovered, including some novel patterns not previously described in the literature.

Our findings quantitatively support many conventional qualitative design guidelines, including that (1) titles and supporting text should convey the message of a visualization, (2) if used appropriately, pictograms do not interfere with understanding and can improve recognition, and (3) redundancy helps effectively communicate the message. Importantly, we show that visualizations memorable \u201cat-a-glance\u201d are also capable of effectively conveying the message of the visualization. Thus, a memorable visualization is often also an effective one.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467732","Keywords":"Information visualization;memorability;recognition;recall;eye-tracking study;Information visualization;memorability;recognition;recall;eye-tracking study"},"478":{"Title":"Projective Peridynamics for Modeling Versatile Elastoplastic Materials","Authors":"X. He; H. Wang; E. Wu","Abstract":"Unified simulation of versatile elastoplastic materials and different dimensions offers many advantages in animation production, contact handling, and hardware acceleration. The unstructured particle representation is particularly suitable for this task, thanks to its simplicity. However, previous meshless techniques either need too much computational cost for addressing stability issues, or lack physical meanings and fail to generate interesting deformation behaviors, such as the Poisson effect. In this paper, we study the development of an elastoplastic model under the state-based peridynamics framework, which uses integrals rather than partial derivatives in its formulation. To model elasticity, we propose a unique constitutive model and an efficient iterative simulator solved in a projective dynamics way. To handle plastic behaviors, we incorporate our simulator with the Drucker-Prager yield criterion and a reference position update scheme, both of which are implemented under peridynamics. Finally, we show how to strengthen the simulator by position-based constraints and spatially varying stiffness models, to achieve incompressibility, particle redistribution, cohesion, and friction effects in viscoelastic and granular flows. Our experiments demonstrate that our unified, meshless simulator is flexible, efficient, robust, and friendly with parallel computing.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2755646","Keywords":"Peridynamics;projective dynamics;position-based dynamics;elasticity;plasticity;viscoelasticity;granular flows"},"479":{"Title":"StreetVizor: Visual Exploration of Human-Scale Urban Forms Based on Street Views","Authors":"Q.

Qu","Abstract":"Urban forms at human-scale, i.e., urban environments that individuals can sense (e.g., sight, smell, and touch) in their daily lives, can provide unprecedented insights on a variety of applications, such as urban planning and environment auditing. The analysis of urban forms can help planners develop high-quality urban spaces through evidence-based design. However, such analysis is complex because of the involvement of spatial, multi-scale (i.e., city, region, and street), and multivariate (e.g., greenery and sky ratios) natures of urban forms. In addition, current methods either lack quantitative measurements or are limited to a small area. The primary contribution of this work is the design of StreetVizor, an interactive visual analytics system that helps planners leverage their domain knowledge in exploring human-scale urban forms based on street view images. Our system presents two-stage visual exploration: 1) an AOI Explorer for the visual comparison of spatial distributions and quantitative measurements in two areas-of-interest (AOIs) at city- and region-scales; 2) and a Street Explorer with a novel parallel coordinate plot for the exploration of the fine-grained details of the urban forms at the street-scale. We integrate visualization techniques with machine learning models to facilitate the detection of street view patterns. We illustrate the applicability of our approach with case studies on the real-world datasets of four cities, i.e., Hong Kong, Singapore, Greater London and New York City. Interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in facilitating various analytical tasks.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744159","Keywords":"Urban forms;human scale;street view;visual analytics"},"480":{"Title":"Graphiti: Interactive Specification of Attribute-Based Edges for Network Modeling and Visualization","Authors":"A. Srinivasan; H. Park; A. Endert; R. C.

While several existing tools allow users to visualize pre-defined networks, creating these networks from raw data remains a challenging task, often requiring users to program custom scripts or write complex SQL commands. Some existing tools also allow users to both visualize and model networks. Interaction techniques adopted by these tools often assume users know the exact conditions for defining edges in the resulting networks. This assumption may not always hold true, however. In cases where users do not know much about attributes in the dataset or when there are several attributes to choose from, users may not know which attributes they could use to formulate linking conditions. We propose an alternate interaction technique to model networks that allows users to demonstrate to the system a subset of nodes and links they wish to see in the resulting network. The system, in response, recommends conditions that can be used to model networks based on the specified nodes and links. In this paper, we show how such a demonstration-based interaction technique can be used to model networks by employing it in a prototype tool, Graphiti. Through multiple usage scenarios, we show how Graphiti not only allows users to model networks from a tabular dataset but also facilitates updating a pre-defined network with additional edge types.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744843","Keywords":"Network modeling;visual analytics;user interaction"},"481":{"Title":"Face to Face: Evaluating Visual Comparison","Authors":"B.

The existing evaluations of designs that facilitate these comparisons tend to be based on intuitive reasoning, rather than quantifiable measures. We build on this work with a series of crowdsourced experiments that use low-level perceptual comparison tasks that arise frequently in comparisons within data visualizations (e.g., which value changes the most between the two sets of data?). Participants completed these tasks across a variety of layouts: overlaid, two arrangements of juxtaposed small multiples, mirror-symmetric small multiples, and animated transitions. A staircase procedure sought the difficulty level (e.g., value change delta) that led to equivalent accuracy for each layout. Confirming prior intuition, we observe high levels of performance for overlaid versus standard small multiples. However, we also find performance improvements for both mirror symmetric small multiples and animated transitions. While some results are incongruent with common wisdom in data visualization, they align with previous work in perceptual psychology, and thus have potentially strong implications for visual comparison designs.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864884","Keywords":"Graphical perception;visual perception;visual comparison;crowdsourced evaluation"},"482":{"Title":"Word-Sized Graphics for Scientific Texts","Authors":"F.

Srinivasan; S. M. Drucker; A. Endert; J.

NLG-based visualization systems typically leverage a suite of statistical functions to automatically extract key facts about the underlying data and surface them as natural language sentences alongside visualizations. With current systems, users are typically required to read the system-generated sentences and mentally map them back to the accompanying visualization. However, depending on the features of the visualization (e.g., visualization type, data density) and the complexity of the data fact, mentally mapping facts to visualizations can be a challenging task. Furthermore, more than one visualization could be used to illustrate a single data fact. Unfortunately, current tools provide little or no support for users to explore such alternatives. In this paper, we explore how system-generated data facts can be treated as interactive widgets to help users interpret visualizations and communicate their findings. We present Voder, a system that lets users interact with automatically-generated data facts to explore both alternative visualizations to convey a data fact as well as a set of embellishments to highlight a fact within a visualization. Leveraging data facts as interactive widgets, Voder also facilitates data fact-based visualization search. To assess Voder's design and features, we conducted a preliminary user study with 12 participants having varying levels of experience with visualization tools. Participant feedback suggested that interactive data facts aided them in interpreting visualizations. Participants also stated that the suggestions surfaced through the facts helped them explore alternative visualizations and embellishments to communicate individual data facts.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2865145","Keywords":"Natural Language Generation;Mixed-initiative Interaction;Visualization Recommendation;Data-driven Communication"},"485":{"Title":"Multi-field Pattern Matching based on Sparse Feature Sampling","Authors":"Z.

First, we extract a sparse set of features for each 3D scalar field using the 3D SIFT algorithm (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform). This allows for a memory-saving description of prominent features in the data with invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Second, the user defines a pattern as a set of SIFT features in multiple fields by e.g. brushing a region of interest. Third, we locate and rank matching patterns in the entire data set.

From an algorithmic point of view, the high-quality light field mode is made possible by a new light field super-resolution method that first improves the spatial resolution and image quality of the side cameras and then interpolates additional views as needed.

In this paper, we propose a novel map representation called Probabilistic Surfel Map (PSM) for dense visual SLAM. The main idea is to maintain a globally consistent map with both photometric and geometric uncertainties encoded in order to address the inconsistency issue. The key of our PSM is proper modeling and updating of sensor measurement uncertainties, as well as the strategies to apply them for improving both the front-end pose estimation and the back-end optimization. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate major improvements with our approach over the state-of-the-art methods.

In general, volumetric meshes contain more primitives than surface meshes, which in turn means larger BVHs. To manage these larger BVHs, we propose an algorithm for splitting meshes into smaller chunks with a limited-size BVH each. Limited-height BVHs make guided, all-pairs testing of two chunked meshes well-suited for GPU implementation. This is because the dynamically generated work during BVH traversal becomes bounded. Chunking is simple to implement compared to dynamic load balancing methods and can result in an overall two orders of magnitude speedup on GPUs. This indicates that dynamic load balancing may not be a well suited scheme for the GPU. The overall application timings showed that data transfers were not the bottleneck. Instead, the conversion to and from OpenCL friendly data structures was causing serious performance impediments. Still, a simple OpenMP acceleration of the conversion allowed the GPU solution to beat the CPU solution by 20 percent.

We present visual-analytics methods to reveal and analyze this hierarchy of similar classes in relation with CNN-internal data. We found that this hierarchy not only dictates the confusion patterns between the classes, it furthermore dictates the learning behavior of CNNs. In particular, the early layers in these networks develop feature detectors that can separate high-level groups of classes quite well, even after a few training epochs. In contrast, the latter layers require substantially more epochs to develop specialized feature detectors that can separate individual classes. We demonstrate how these insights are key to significant improvement in accuracy by designing hierarchy-aware CNNs that accelerate model convergence and alleviate overfitting.

The absence of ground-truth labels makes it impossible to define an optimal solution, thus requiring user judgment to establish what can be considered a satisfiable clustering result.

A conventional approach transforms a background image with a homography matrix calculated on the basis of a camera pose and overlays the transformed image on an AR marker region in a real-time frame, assuming that the AR marker is on a planar surface. However, this approach may cause discontinuities in textures around the boundary between the marker and its surrounding area when the planar surface assumption is not satisfied. This paper proposes a method for AR marker hiding without discontinuities around texture boundaries even under nonplanar background geometry without measuring it. For doing this, our method estimates the dense motion in the marker's background by analyzing the motion of sparse feature points around it, together with a smooth motion assumption, and deforms the background image according to it.

An offline 3D numerical simulation is performed at each probe and the resulting field is encoded for runtime rendering with dynamic sources. Prior work place probes on a uniform grid, requiring high density to resolve narrow spaces. Our adaptive sampling approach varies probe density based on a novel \u201clocal diameter\u201d measure of the space surrounding a given point, evaluated by stochastically tracing paths in the scene. We apply this measure to layout probes so as to smoothly adapt resolution and eliminate undersampling in corners, narrow corridors and stairways, while coarsening appropriately in more open areas. Coupled with a new runtime interpolator based on radial weights over geodesic paths, we achieve smooth acoustic effects that respect scene boundaries as both the source or listener move, unlike existing visibility-based solutions. We consistently demonstrate quality improvement over prior work at fixed cost.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2019.2898765","Keywords":"Diffraction;interpolation;mean free path;radial basis function;ray tracing;reciprocity;room acoustics;wave simulation"},"505":{"Title":"Coloring 3D Printed Surfaces by Thermoforming","Authors":"Y. Zhang; Y. Tong; K. Zhou","Abstract":"Decorating the surfaces of 3D printed objects with color textures is still not readily available in most consumer-level or even high-end 3D printers. Existing techniques such as hydrographics color transfer suffer from the issues of air pockets in concave regions and discoloration in overly stretched regions. We propose a novel thermoforming-based coloring technique to alleviate these problems as well as to simplify the overall procedure. Thermoforming is a widely used technique in industry for plastic thin shell product manufacturing by pressing heated plastic sheets onto molds using atmospheric pressure. We attach on the transparent plastic sheet a precomputed color pattern decal prior to heating, and adhere it to 3D printed models treated as the molds in thermoforming. The 3D models are thus decorated with the desired color texture, as well as a thin, polished protective cover. The precomputation involves a physical simulation of the thermoforming process to compute the correct color pattern on the plastic sheet, and the vent hole layout on the 3D model for air pocket elimination. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our computational model and our prototype thermoforming surface coloring system through physical experiments.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2598570","Keywords":"3D printing;thermoforming;thermoplastic sheet simulation;texture mapping"},"506":{"Title":"Exploring Multivariate Event Sequences Using Rules, Aggregations, and Selections","Authors":"B.

Besides standard properties such as type and timestamp, events often have other associated multivariate data. Current exploration and analysis methods either focus on the temporal analysis of a single attribute or the structural analysis of the multivariate data only. We present an approach where users can explore event sequences at multivariate and sequential level simultaneously by interactively defining a set of rewrite rules using multivariate regular expressions. Users can store resulting patterns as new types of events or attributes to interactively enrich or simplify event sequences for further investigation. In Eventpad we provide a bottom-up glyph-oriented approach for multivariate event sequence analysis by searching, clustering, and aligning them according to newly defined domain specific properties. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach with real-world data sets including telecommunication traffic and hospital treatments.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2745278","Keywords":"Event Visualization;Multivariate Events;Regular Expressions;Sequence Alignment;Interaction"},"507":{"Title":"Visual Analysis of Aneurysm Data using Statistical Graphics","Authors":"M.

The rupture of an aneurysm is often a fatal scenario, whereas during treatment serious complications for the patient can occur. Whether an aneurysm ruptures or whether a treatment is successful depends on the interaction of different morphological such as wall deformation and thickness, and hemodynamic attributes like wall shear stress and pressure. Therefore, medical researchers are very interested in better understanding these relationships. However, the required analysis is a time-consuming process, where suspicious wall regions are difficult to detect due to the time-dependent behavior of the data. Our proposed visualization framework enables medical researchers to efficiently assess aneurysm risk and treatment options. This comprises a powerful set of views including 2D and 3D depictions of the aneurysm morphology as well as statistical plots of different scalar fields. Brushing and linking aids the user to identify interesting wall regions and to understand the influence of different attributes on the aneurysm's state. Moreover, a visual comparison of pre- and post-treatment as well as different treatment options is provided. Our analysis techniques are designed in collaboration with domain experts, e.g., physicians, and we provide details about the evaluation.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2018.2864509","Keywords":"Medical visualizations;aneurysms;blood flow;parametrization"},"508":{"Title":"Stable Treemaps via Local Moves","Authors":"M. Sondag; B. Speckmann; K. Verbeek","Abstract":"Treemaps are a popular tool to visualize hierarchical data: items are represented by nested rectangles and the area of each rectangle corresponds to the data being visualized for this item. The visual quality of a treemap is commonly measured via the aspect ratio of the rectangles. If the data changes, then a second important quality criterion is the stability of the treemap: how much does the treemap change as the data changes. We present a novel stable treemapping algorithm that has very high visual quality. Whereas existing treemapping algorithms generally recompute the treemap every time the input changes, our algorithm changes the layout of the treemap using only local modifications. This approach not only gives us direct control over stability, but it also allows us to use a larger set of possible layouts, thus provably resulting in treemaps of higher visual quality compared to existing algorithms. We further prove that we can reach all possible treemap layouts using only our local modifications. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure for stability that better captures the relative positions of rectangles. We finally show via experiments on real-world data that our algorithm outperforms existing treemapping algorithms also in practice on either visual quality and\/or stability. Our algorithm scores high on stability regardless of whether we use an existing stability measure or our new measure.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2745140","Keywords":"Treemap;Stability;Local Moves"},"509":{"Title":"DXR: A Toolkit for Building Immersive Data Visualizations","Authors":"R.

However, creating immersive visualizations remains challenging, and often require complex low-level programming and tedious manual encoding of data attributes to geometric and visual properties. These can hinder the iterative idea-to-prototype process, especially for developers without experience in 3D graphics, AR, and VR programming. With DXR, developers can efficiently specify visualization designs using a concise declarative visualization grammar inspired by Vega-Lite. DXR further provides a GUI for easy and quick edits and previews of visualization designs in-situ, i.e., while immersed in the virtual world. DXR also provides reusable templates and customizable graphical marks, enabling unique and engaging visualizations.

A special graph is created to store and manifest real traffic information recorded by taxi trajectories over city streets. It conveys urban transportation dynamics which can be discovered by applying graph analysis algorithms. To support interactive, multiscale visual analytics, a graph partitioning algorithm is applied to create region-level graphs which have smaller size than the original street-level graph. Graph centralities, including Pagerank and betweenness, are computed to characterize the time-varying importance of different urban regions. The centralities are visualized by three coordinated views including a node-link graph view, a map view and a temporal information view. Users can interactively examine the importance of streets to discover and assess city traffic patterns. We have implemented a fully working prototype of this approach and evaluated it using massive taxi trajectories of Shenzhen, China. TrajGraph's capability in revealing the importance of city streets was evaluated by comparing the calculated centralities with the subjective evaluations from a group of drivers in Shenzhen. Feedback from a domain expert was collected. The effectiveness of the visual interface was evaluated through a formal user study. We also present several examples and a case study to demonstrate the usefulness of TrajGraph in urban transportation analysis.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467771","Keywords":"Graph based visual analytics;Centrality;Taxi trajectories;Urban network;Transportation assessment;Graph based visual analytics;Centrality;Taxi trajectories;Urban network;Transportation assessment"},"513":{"Title":"Vials: Visualizing Alternative Splicing of Genes","Authors":"H. Strobelt; B. Alsallakh; J. Botros; B. Peterson; M. Borowsky; H. Pfister; A.

Alternative splicing works by selectively omitting some of the coding regions (exons) typically associated with a gene. Detection of alternative splicing is difficult and uses a combination of advanced data acquisition methods and statistical inference. Knowledge about the abundance of isoforms is important for understanding both normal processes and diseases and to eventually improve treatment through targeted therapies. The data, however, is complex and current visualizations for isoforms are neither perceptually efficient nor scalable. To remedy this, we developed Vials, a novel visual analysis tool that enables analysts to explore the various datasets that scientists use to make judgments about isoforms: the abundance of reads associated with the coding regions of the gene, evidence for junctions, i.e., edges connecting the coding regions, and predictions of isoform frequencies. Vials is scalable as it allows for the simultaneous analysis of many samples in multiple groups. Our tool thus enables experts to (a) identify patterns of isoform abundance in groups of samples and (b) evaluate the quality of the data. We demonstrate the value of our tool in case studies using publicly available datasets.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2015.2467911","Keywords":"Biology visualization;protein isoforms;mRNA-seq;directed acyclic graphs;multivariate networks;Biology visualization;protein isoforms;mRNA-seq;directed acyclic graphs;multivariate networks"},"514":{"Title":"MixedFusion: Real-Time Reconstruction of an Indoor Scene with Dynamic Objects","Authors":"H.

Previous works of this topic consider pure static scenes, but in this paper, we focus on more challenging cases that the scene contains dynamic objects, for example, moving people and floating curtains, which are quite common in reality and thus are eagerly required to be handled. We develop an end-to-end system using a depth sensor to scan a scene on the fly. By proposing a Sigmoid-based Iterative Closest Point (S-ICP) method, we decouple the camera motion and the scene motion from the input sequence and segment the scene into static and dynamic parts accordingly. The static part is used to estimate the camera rigid motion, while for the dynamic part, graph node-based motion representation and model-to-depth fitting are applied to reconstruct the scene motions. With the camera and scene motions reconstructed, we further propose a novel mixed voxel allocation scheme to handle static and dynamic scene parts with different mechanisms, which helps to gradually fuse a large scene with both static and dynamic objects. Experiments show that our technique successfully fuses the geometry of both the static and dynamic objects in a scene in real time, which extends the usage of the current techniques for indoor scene reconstruction.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2786233","Keywords":"Scene reconstruction;dynamic reconstruction;single view"},"515":{"Title":"Real-Time Cloth Rendering with Fiber-Level Detail","Authors":"K.

However, rendering fiber-level cloth models not only has a high memory cost but it also has a high computation cost even for offline rendering applications. In this paper we present a real-time fiber-level cloth rendering method for current GPUs. Our method procedurally generates fiber-level geometric details on-the-fly using yarn-level control points for minimizing the data transfer to the GPU. We also reduce the rasterization operations by collectively representing the fibers near the center of each ply that form the yarn structure. Moreover, we employ a level-of-detail strategy to minimize or completely eliminate the generation of fiber-level geometry that would have little or no impact on the final rendered image. Furthermore, we introduce a simple self-shadow computation method that allows lighting with self-shadows using relatively low-resolution shadow maps. We also provide a simple distance-based ambient occlusion approximation as well as an ambient illumination precomputation approach, both of which account for fiber-level self-occlusion of yarn. Finally, we discuss how to use a physical-based shading model with our fiber-level cloth rendering method and how to handle cloth animations with temporal coherency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing our simplified fiber geometry to procedurally generated references and display knitwear containing more than a hundred million individual fiber curves at real-time frame rates with shadows and ambient occlusion.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2731949","Keywords":"Cloth rendering;procedural geometry;real-time rendering"},"516":{"Title":"Real-Time Interactive Tree Animation","Authors":"E.

This is accomplished by using an articulated rigid body model with as-stiff-as-desired rotational springs in conjunction with our newly proposed simulation technique, which is motivated both by position based dynamics and the typical O(N) algorithms for articulated rigid bodies. The efficiency of our algorithm allows us to pose and animate trees with millions of branches or alternatively simulate a small forest comprised of many highly detailed trees. Even using only a single CPU core, we can simulate ten thousand branches in real time while still maintaining quite crisp user interactivity.

Hu; D. Yan; D. Bommes; P. Alliez; B. Benes","Abstract":"Surface remeshing is a key component in many geometry processing applications. The typical goal consists in finding a mesh that is (1) geometrically faithful to the original geometry, (2) as coarse as possible to obtain a low-complexity representation and (3) free of bad elements that would hamper the desired application (e.g.,\u00a0the minimum interior angle is above an application-dependent threshold). Our algorithm is designed to address all three optimization goals simultaneously by targeting prescribed bounds on approximation error  $\\delta$ , minimal interior angle $\\theta$  and maximum mesh complexity $N$  (number of vertices). The approximation error bound $\\delta$  is a hard constraint, while the other two criteria are modeled as optimization goals to guarantee feasibility. Our optimization framework applies carefully prioritized local operators in order to greedily search for the coarsest mesh with minimal interior angle above $\\theta$  and approximation error bounded by $\\delta$ . Fast runtime is enabled by a local approximation error estimation, while implicit feature preservation is obtained by specifically designed vertex relocation operators. Experiments show that for reasonable angle bounds ( $\\theta \\leq 35^\\circ$ ) our approach delivers high-quality meshes with implicitly preserved features (no tagging required) and better balances between geometric fidelity, mesh complexity and element quality than the state-of-the-art.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2016.2632720","Keywords":"Surface remeshing;error-bounded;feature preserving;minimal angle improvement;saliency function"},"518":{"Title":"Homography Propagation and Optimization for Wide-Baseline Street Image Interpolation","Authors":"Y.

We present a lightweight and efficient method which uses simple homography computing and refining operators to estimate piecewise smooth homographies between input views. To achieve the goal, we show how to combine homography fitting and homography propagation together based on reliable and unreliable superpixel discrimination. Such a combination, other than using homography fitting only, dramatically increases the accuracy and robustness of the estimated homographies. Then, we integrate the concepts of homography and mesh warping, and propose a novel homography-constrained warping formulation which enforces smoothness between neighboring homographies by utilizing the first-order continuity of the warped mesh. This further eliminates small artifacts of overlapping, stretching, etc. The proposed method is lightweight and flexible, allows wide-baseline interpolation. It improves the state of the art and demonstrates that homography computation suffices for interpolation.

Active learning approaches been shown to improve statistical reasoning, but are rarely applied in visualizing uncertainty in scientific reports. We present a controlled study to evaluate the impact of an interactive, graphical uncertainty prediction technique for communicating uncertainty in experiment results. Using our technique, users sketch their prediction of the uncertainty in experimental effects prior to viewing the true sampling distribution from an experiment. We find that having a user graphically predict the possible effects from experiment replications is an effective way to improve one's ability to make predictions about replications of new experiments. Additionally, visualizing uncertainty as a set of discrete outcomes, as opposed to a continuous probability distribution, can improve recall of a sampling distribution from a single experiment.
